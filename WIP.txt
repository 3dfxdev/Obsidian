WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Quake3 CSG Code
---------------

+  texture coords for brushes:
   - can set a default "u_scale" and "v_scale" for textures
     [ new gui.texture_prop() function ]

   - specify uv coords in brushes:
     - tu, tv in each side (for top face
     - bu, bv in each side (for bottom face)
     - u1,u2, v1,v2 in side faces

+  better triangulation  [ review q3map2 code ]

+  lighting
   - ensure detail brushes are handled  [ being lit AND blocking light ]
   - make vertex lighting be average of a face
   - ensure sun lighting works
   - grid lighting

LATER:  reject detail surfaces lying completely inside a solid brush

DONE:  visibility
DONE:  clip brushes
DONE:  sky surfaces
DONE:  sloped floors and ceilings
DONE:  liquid areas and surfaces
DONE:  mapmodels



Weapon planning:

+  make distribution depend in Weapons setting
   -  probably make "mixed" be like "heaps" (in this regard)



Revamped UI:

+  implement the new settings
   -  "ramp_up"
   -  "bosses"

   -  "bit_less" for health/ammo

   -  "lighting"
   -  "detail"



REQUEST:  An option to select "progressive" for weapons to reflect the
          IWAD's pacing would be appreciated"

          "or just spread the intro of weapons out more"


Review "weak" strength, esp. guard monsters

  I agree that TWO of the hell knights and revenants is too much for the
  first level of "weak" strength, and maybe revenant is too strong a monster
  to appear that early.

  Adjust the calculations based on level size, e.g. when first
  level or two are small, then spread the guards/bosses out more
