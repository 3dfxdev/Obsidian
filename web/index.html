<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

OBLIGE is a random level generator for various classic
games, such as DOOM and DOOM II (more coming soon).
The goal is to produce
high quality levels which are fun to play.

Released Oblige 0.97.
This is a small update to version 0.94 which fixes the error
about stair placement that occured sometimes
(aborting the whole build).
It also includes Sam Trenholme's expanded set of Heretic themes.

Oblige 0.94 is released!

<p>
Major changes in version 0.94 include a new prefab system,
new theming system, different sized rooms,
greatly improved Hexen support,
secret areas and levels, and
experimental support for Wolfenstein 3D.

<p>
During development I came to the conclusion that the current algorithms
are the wrong way to do things, and that a big rewrite of OBLIGE's
level-building code is urgently needed. So I'm releasing this version
as-is, even though some things are broken (notably the monster closet
traps).

<p>
This version will occasionally abort the map-building process with an
error message, for example saying it cannot place a stair in a room.
This is symptom of the messed up level-building code and another reason
why the rewrite is necessary. The only workaround is to try a different
SEED value.

Oblige 0.85 has been released.
This includes many major improvements:
support for hallways, crates, and new exit rooms,
better selection of floor and ceiling heights,
user adjustments for health, ammo, monsters and traps,
and support for TNT Evilution and Plutonia.
User settings are also remembered when you quit.
