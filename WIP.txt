WORK IN PROGRESS
================


+  SHAPE GRAMMARS:

   +  better logic for connections, allow explicit ones in each rule,
      and detect them automatically when none
      [ not just to new rooms, but also to new areas/closets/etc ]

   +  prune / re-use rooms which remain small, and hallways which
      never end up anywhere else

   +  symmetrical rooms
      +  a way to score "straddling" patterns higher
         [ they are a very good place for some stuff, e.g. exits ]
         [[ only first usage of SPROUT/DECOR needs to score higher ]]

      -  join mirrored seeds with 'peer' field

      -  SPROUT pass : try some without a mirrored half

      -  SPROUT: if mirrored and new rooms touch/overlap, only create
                 a single room

   idea:  'o' used in matches for "open" part of room (floor/stair/liquid)

   idea:  'a', 'b', 'c' matches anything but "1", "2", "3"
          Q/ does "anything" included empty space / other rooms?

   idea:  a CYCLE pass (after SPROUT) for multiple paths

   idea:  for CTF, create one big room with "rotate" symmetry
          [ interleave GROW and SPROUT passes ]
          [[ "new_room" becomes "new_area" but acting like a new room ]]

   idea:  GLOBAL rules : applied to whole map after everything else is done


-  titlepic backgrounds (current and new) :
   determine ones for official package, put rest in an addon


+  face direction for switches


!!  some trap doors do not open
    [ door next-to door thing.... ]
