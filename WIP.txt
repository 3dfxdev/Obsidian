WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Quake3 CSG Code
---------------

+  better triangulation  [ review q3map2 code ]

+  lighting
   >>  optimise detail face intersection

   - "noshadow" for brushes / faces

   + a shared lightmap for 100% low-light

   + implement ambient system -- every face belongs to a "room" and
     ambient value for the room is specified by Lua
     [ for grid lighting, find face directly underneath point ]

-  brushlib function to visit side faces, and if they
   contain u1/u2/v1/v2 then compute the uv_mat

-  brushlib function to visit top/bottom faces, and generate
   a uv_mat if the sides contain tu/tv/bu/bv values

LATER : re-implement super-sampling for lighting

LATER : reject detail surfaces lying completely inside a solid brush

DONE:  visibility
DONE:  clip brushes
DONE:  sky surfaces
DONE:  sloped floors and ceilings
DONE:  liquid areas and surfaces
DONE:  mapmodels



Revamped UI:

+  implement the new settings
   -  "ramp_up"
   -  "bosses"



Review "weak" strength, esp. guard monsters

  I agree that TWO of the hell knights and revenants is too much for the
  first level of "weak" strength, and maybe revenant is too strong a monster
  to appear that early.

  Adjust the calculations based on level size, e.g. when first
  level or two are small, then spread the guards/bosses out more
