WORK IN PROGRESS
================


>>> use PARAM for game_tweaks module


FAQ : vanilla DOOM not supported


+  game_tweaks "Kept Weapons" option


Q/ use CC-BY-3 or 4 for all prefabs / images / prebuilt maps


Wrong texturing when pillar (underneath a 3D bridge) intersects


-  sometimes make a floor (its side) use same material as top (not room wall)



Closets and Traps:
-  can use unused seeds [inside map area]
-  can use junked parts of a room
-  can use a SOLID seed in a pattern (c.f. cage code)

-  can steal part of a nearby scenic, but require all three sides
   (and two diagonals) to remain part of scenic room


Doors
-  Door_with_bars : use it
+  make a dark-metal switch for Door_with_bars

-  support wide doors [normal / locked]
-  make wide prefab with a switch in it [normal door]
-  texturing on door prefabs (for HELL, URBAN themes)
