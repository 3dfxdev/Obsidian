WORK IN PROGRESS
================



Scenic Borders
--------------

+  proper sky handling

+  different styles:
   - mountainy areas  (w/ trees or torches)
   - cavey/liquidy areas
   - fenced off pools from V7-WEIRD
   - fancy fences



PARKS
-----

+  proper sky handling

+  height variation  [ different areas ]

-  texturing
   [ in constructed outdoors, don't use natural tex like GRASS
     except in the lowest area ]

-  add a style for it, decide room properly



Miscellaneous
-------------

??? on LAST max_loop attempt, set sprout_bbox to boundary_bbox

idea: on LAST max_loop attempt, allow extra teleporters

-  grower: compute a score early, do a check on first whole-seed
   "area" element and do the "max_size" check here too

-  if room has a boss/guard needing a large chunk, allocate those
   chunks early [ but allow importants to override in emergencies ]

stairs : prevent two stairs from touching

steepness : IF exist on a rule AND room is outdoor THEN prob *= 0.5



Exit Rooms
----------

+  force first area to be boss-monster spot (at least one),
   be tall enough (at least 128), and never has a decoration
   or floor sink

??  if exit room failed to sprout (or that room was killed) then
    force usage of a teleporter
    [ ideally: start again...... ]



Hallway System
--------------

+  construct them from pieces (each one is a prefab)

-  "terminator" pieces between hall and room
   [ need plain, key locked, switch locked versions... ]

-  different styles:
   - a "vent" style
   - a "curvey" style like in V5
   - a wide-ish one with stairs, like in V4
   - a techy one like in V5/V6



Quake3 CSG Code
---------------

+  better triangulation  [ review q3map2 code ]

-  brushlib function to visit side faces, and if they
   contain u1/u2/v1/v2 then compute the uv_mat

-  brushlib function to visit top/bottom faces, and generate
   a uv_mat if the sides contain tu/tv/bu/bv values
