WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Weapon count: not just based on # of zone, more about 'game_along'


IDEA: 'level' field for NICE_ITEMS -- especially invulnerability which
      seems to appear quite late in TNT and Plutonia


BUG: door height on hallways  [ plus want no hall_shape there ]


Map borders
-----------

+  fix sky height next to certain walls  (very tall, looks bad)

-  in "water" kind, fix using liquid for some solid cells



Liquid pools
------------

+  fences instead of "wall" (c.f. Room_border_up)



Closets
-------

+  really want to add them _AFTER_ large traps/cages have been
   added (and after outdoor borders too)



Sinks
-----

+  decide them fairly early, e.g. Room_add_sinks() -- or in layout code
   
-  add "light" to ceilings with a light texture

-  detect the "whole seed" part early (easy: all corners are inner points)
   and [for floors only] give the seed a new floor_h/floor_mat, and honor
   that floor_h when adding importants or decorative prefabs.

-  monsters: should not straddle the line between normal floor and sink
   [ draw that line in spot code ] and ideally would have correct 'Z'

-  probably should mark seeds (or whatever) so know where can place
   decorative prefabs.



Monster defs : min weapon level needed [esp. for Vile/Bosses ]
-  player weapon in three states : no have / getting / have it
   ("getting" applies to whole zone)
   when "getting" it, allow monster but reduce prob/density
   (allow monster for guard)

(a) Support min_weapon and weap_needed for GUARD monsters


Items:
-  rework distribution logic
   ( get_previous_locs is broken atm)



Secrets....
!!  make the secret door (or fence, etc)



Traps....
-  second pass : traps ON WAY BACK to the ...

+  make more traps over a episode/game



Porches :
+  one per room

+  fix missing posts (where touch edge of map)

+  floor MUST be >= nearby floors (ignoring void / walled junctions)
   [ do it via floor-heights algorithm)

-  experiment with railings instead of posts (want #conns >= 2)

-  indoors or dark outdoors : light fittings



Texturing:

SORT OUT : where 'facade_mat' is stored, how is accessed
  - basically, each indoor room (cave or building) has a facade_mat
    (defaulting to ZONE.building_facade or ZONE.cave_mat)

  - for outdoor<-->outdoor, use the fence texture (ZONE.fence_mat)

  - for void, use area 'kind'

-  texturing on door prefabs (for HELL, URBAN themes)



lowering bars between outdoor rooms

implement "arch" junction / prefab

area/room with key/exit/etc are good for windows

if area floor is >= all neighbors, sometimes mark as "want rail" (instead of fence)

Courtyard floor should be > Landscape floor.



Q/ use CC-BY-3 or 4 for all prefabs / images / prebuilt maps


IDEA: have a single thing number for "coop player"
      [ i.e. treat player entities more abstractly ]


-  sometimes make a floor side use same material as top (not room wall)


REQUEST:  mix it up option for the quiet start setting.
