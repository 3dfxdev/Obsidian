WORK IN PROGRESS
================


SINKS:

+  set ceiling of stairs to highest nearby ceil group
   !!  test stair prefab for "plain_ceiling" flag

   -  allow ceiling sinks to span simple stairs
   -  prevent spanning lifts
   -  fix ambient lighting for stairs / lifts

-  fix interaction with decorations :

   -  floor sinks *can* inhibit floor-decorations :

   -  check inner point of middle of 2x2 chunk (more if bigger)
      and if it is "floor_inner" then *can* allow a decoration
      [ depending on, um, ..... def.no_sink ]

DONE: for importants (like KEYS), make *them* inhibit sinks
DONE: for SKY holes, require group.h >= max_floor + 128
