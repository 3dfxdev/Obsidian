Current Work
------------


THEME SYSTEM:
??  allow materials in 'facades', 'walls' (etc) to not exist,
    and simply remove that entry from the table.  Same for entity
    stuff.  Hence can share room themes between DOOM and DOOM 2.


-  Jared's DEIMOS theme additions


implement ZONE_THEMES  (via 'zones' field) and ROOM_THEME (via 'room' field)

- use current code to "construct" a zone theme if none present
  (similarly for rooms)

- rarity="zone" for ROOM_THEMES  [also: "level", "episode" and "game" keywords]

? ubiquity keyword ?



Caves:
  >>  newbie_map  : generate separate pass, check for <= 0 cells

  DONE:  CHUNKS: don't build floor/ceil if cave
  DONE:  handle disconnected areas
  DONE:  fill any unconnected empty areas
  DONE:  optimise touch_chunk with bbox check

  !!!!  spots for monsters and items

  >>>  get the diagonalisation working again (on FLOORS too)

  !!  determine touching lists

  >>  proper floor and ceiling textures

  -  better floors, liquid areas

  -  better ceilings, chance of sky

  -  create a large area (or two) by merging areas together
     [OR: pre-allocate a large chunk / reclaimed junction]

  DONE:  QUAKE: avoid caves for intermission camera


Monsters:
REVIEW: how strength setting affects room palettes

  +  in later levels, low-level monsters should be used in bigger swarms


QUAKE II:
  +  fix street mode edges (you can fall out of the level)


Liquids:
  ?  generate liquid "AREAs" at same time as normal areas 
     (by looking at free seeds).  Similarly for cages and 3D areas.
     Create chunks after the seeds have been decided.


Hallways:
  +  don't assume all chunks can be open to each other
     (i.e. there is a distinct path, put walls everywhere else)

  !!!  fix chunk alignment in hallway connections

  !!  monsters / items in hallways

  !!!  determine ceiling heights properly


Zones:

>>>  distinct texturing in each zone

  -  prefer weapons be placed in different zones
     rather than: two in second zone, none in third (or so).

     Note: does NOT apply to the starting room

  DONE:  switches and their doors are limited to a single zone
  DONE:  keyed doors are preferred separator for zones

  -  Idea: ZONE_THEMES

  +  if keys are left over, can use them for non-Zone locks


Storage Rooms:
  -  actually use them for, um, storage

  -  prefer adding weapons into these STORAGE rooms
     (rather than another room in the quest, ESPECIALLY solution room)


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

+  proper building facades

   -  create "scenic" chunks in unused seeds as part of a building 

+  windows and fences

   -  must decide after all heights are done

   -  need to harmonize sky heights

   -  windows and fences DO NOT straddle, and outdoor rooms ARE NOT
      responsible for the outdoor facade of buildings.

+  sky borders in outdoor rooms


-  pictures in walls

-  diagonal corners

-  secret niches


?  system for texture coordinates:

     u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

     x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
     y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)

?  cages

?  normal doors

?  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

?  better exits
