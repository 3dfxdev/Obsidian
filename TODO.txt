OBLIGE TODO
===========

Current Work
------------


DONE: big junc: require "direct" connections (i.e. ROOM, MID, BJ)

      -  big junction chunk must keep track of exit dirs
         [wall off unused dirs]


Hallways:

  +  double hallways
     -  make some L shape (not just U shape)

  !!  proper scoring  [done??]


Crossovers:
  !!  get working again

  !!  put stairs in the mini-hallways  [Cycles too]

  +  build the bridges / channels using prefabs

  -  fix hallway vertical gaps
 

Cycles:
   +  less chance if R2 (skipped room) is large


Areas:
  +  fix ability for stairs to go from A2 --> A1
     (in other words: ability for stair chunk to be in unset floor)


-----------------------------------------------------------------


++  create AUTHORS.txt / simplify Credits web page

++  some VOID seeds
    -  void requires 6x6 surrounding non-void room and must not
       touch scenic chunks
    -  better indoors than outdoors
    -  good for cages!
    -  often create an area surrounding it

++  LIQUID areas

++  LOGO pictures on indoor walls (DOOM format games)


!!!  the "apply twice" problem in prefab build code

+    support m="bounds" brushes (e.g. for QUAKE2_TELEPORTER)


WISH: 3D bridges can be 3D stairs [relax area touching rule]



FIX: areas may be separated by "scenic" chunks
     --> prevent that, c.f. sub-room logic in V3


Windows: MUST decide them after all heights are done



5. corner prefab -- chunk is assumed not to be passable anymore,
   can make the whole thing solid [c.f. the V3 corner seeds]
   or make a curve or diagonal -- anything a prefab can do.
   
   need to make sure that room stays traversible

6. wall prefab -- touches one (and only one) edge of room,
   could make whole thing solid, or whatever a prefab can do.

7. big middle prefab, e.g. nukage pit



>>>  Simple rooms (caves and mazes)


-  build all hallways AFTER all rooms
   (decide a height different first though).


OTHER STUFF

!!  u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

    x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
    y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)



Goals for next WIP
==================

FOCUS WILL BE: room connection logic

+  decent hallways

+  cycles

+  crossovers

DONE:  teleporters



Release Goals
=============

+  working pictures

+  caves working again

+  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

-  system for texture coordinates


-  liquid areas

-  windows

-  normal doors

-  cages

-  secret niches


?  better exits

?  diagonal corners
