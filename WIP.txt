WORK IN PROGRESS
================


3D Floors:
-  next to room with liquid -- odd gap is possible

-  cutting off windows / player can run out them
-  cutting off pictures

-  light from above can "go right through"



Spot handling:
-  update Cave code
   -  get bbox (real coord / cells) for each AREA
   -  only use that bbox
   +  initial state should be CLEAR

   -  _skip_ cells of the floor itself
   -  use R:spots_do_edges()
   -  use gui.spots_apply_brushes()
   +  copy logic for height checking



Layout rework:
+  create chunks for ALL non-cave rooms

-  CHUNK_CLASS ?   put in seed.lua

-  CHUNK.content (not SEED.content)

-  link chunks together

-  create chunks for flat square room
   V
-  split big chunks: 4 = 2/2  5 = 2/1/2 or 1/3/1  6 = 2/2/2  (etc)
   (maintain symmetry if chunk straddles middle of room)

-  split any chunks which contain TWO importants or conns
   (detect if horiz or vertical, and where)

IDEA:  automatically merge 2x2 seeds (if floor) into a single chunk

-  get curved stairs working again
-  get diagonals working again

+  recursive patterns!
   -  use 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd' instead of '1', '2' (etc)

   -  detect if no stair was used, automatically and randomly
      pick "intra conn" when installing into the room

   -  have "floor_groups" -- each seed in the group must get the
      same VHR floor [ probably OK if different floors above/below ]

   -  perhaps have "recurse = onion" patterns, and we try a certain
      quota (based on depth) of these BEFORE all other patterns.

??  the 'is_top' pattern must touch the entry_conn (if present)

IDEA:  auto-sub-areas : in huge room, sub-divide into smaller rectangles
       and place "intra connections" between them.  Place patterns in
       each sub-area, ensuring the intra connections are "floor".


Junking:
-  caves: sometimes junk a side or two
   - only at edge of map (?)
   - 1 or 2 seeds deep

-  normal junking : upto 2 seeds at edge of map


Closets and Traps:
-  can use unused seeds [inside map area]
-  can use junked parts of a room
-  can use a SOLID seed in a pattern (c.f. cage code)

-  can steal part of a nearby scenic, but require all three sides
   (and two diagonals) to remain part of scenic room


Doors
-  Door_with_bars : use it
+  make a dark-metal switch for Door_with_bars
-  make a two seed wide door prefab
-  support wide doors [normal / locked]
-  make wide prefab with a switch in it [normal door]
-  texturing on door prefabs (for HELL, URBAN themes)


Cave lighting:
-  keys / switches (etc) should be lit up



MISCELLANEA
===========


corner_up : a pass over all seeds (like fences)


RAIL ISSUE : cannot control offsets on BACK SIDE of a brush vert
--->  test new logic....


wad-fab loader : x_offset handling not right (if line is split)


???  last_file stuff?  Default_location??
