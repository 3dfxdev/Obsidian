OBLIGE TODO
===========

Current Work
------------


>>>  stairs for new area code


-  build lock doorways completely on room side


Hallways:

!!!  no adjusters (for Cycles and Crossovers)


WISH: outdoor hallways (wall on one side, fence on other side, sky top)
      [may be easier to convert hallway into a room]
      hard part: ensuring such a hallway stays above nearby room(s)
      hmmm, could also work bordering an _indoor_ room (no sky)


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Short-Term Goals
================

+  hallway stuff sorted out

+  theme stuff sorted out

+  windows

   -  must decide after all heights are done



+  fix for ugly sky in outdoor room near a hallway
   (mark those seeds, detect in from_edge pass)

+  fix monsters stuck in doors / corners of chunks

!!?!!  LOCKED DOORS IN A WHOLE SEED/CHUNK

-  review Fence code

-  light_globe and flame entities for QUAKE

-  in prefab skins: '_long = 23' means 2 to 3 seeds wide
                    '_deep = 14' means 1 to 4 seeds deep

-  automatically create bridges over channels

+  automatic repeating of prefabs
   x_repeat=192 : means we require: x_size / N >= x_repeat (for highest N)

   allow it to happen with prefab composition too

-  outdoor wall extender: 64x64 block with torch on top

Idea: for outdoor bordering, have earlier pass to set the facade_mat
      in _all_ unused seeds (grow existing buildings)

+  flat mismatch where hallways meet rooms
   (a) have a step (ideally not flush with wall)
   (b) put a door there
   (c) use floor texture in hallway (only works at one end)

Hallways:

+  double hallways STILL busted (entry from the non-forky end)

+  HALLWAY_GROUPS

      basic =
      {
        Hall_basic_I = 50
        Hall_basic_V = 50
        Hall_basic_S = 50

        Hall_basic_C = 50
        Hall_basic_T = 50
        Hall_basic_P = 50

        Junc_basic_I = 50
        Junc_basic_C = 50
        Junc_basic_T = 50
        Junc_basic_P = 50
      }

      IN LEVEL THEME:

      hall_groups = { basic=50, curvilicious=50 }

Theme System:

-  proper room themes for QUAKE

-  QUAKE II


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

-  pictures in walls

-  diagonal corners

-  secret niches

-  cages (in the void chunks)

-  normal doors

?  system for texture coordinates:

     u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

     x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
     y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)

?  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

?  better exits
