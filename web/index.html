<h1>OBLIGE Level Maker</h1>

by Andrew Apted. &nbsp; January 2007


<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

OBLIGE is a random level maker for the following games:
DOOM&nbsp;1, DOOM&nbsp;2, Heretic&nbsp;1 and Hexen&nbsp;1.
These games all share the same basic level structure.

<p>
OBLIGE will have the following features which set it apart
from existing programs
(like <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/slige/">SLIGE</a> by David Chess)

<ul>
  <li>higher quality levels, e.g. outdoor areas!
  <li>easy to use GUI interface (no messing with command lines)
  <li>built-in node builder, so the created levels are ready to play
  <li>uses the LUA scripting language for easy experimentation
  <li>can create Deathmatch levels
  <li>Heretic and Hexen support!
</ul>


<h2>STATUS</h2>

OBLIGE 0.81 was the very first public release.
The core level-making algorithm exists and works quite well,
and the GUI is mostly usable (still missing some bells and
whistles).  The battle simulator seems to produce reasonable
ammo/health for the monsters in the map.

<p>
There is no support yet for the special levels, such as E1M8
(end of episode) of DOOM 1 and MAP30 (end of game) of DOOM 2.

<p>
Nearly every decision in OBLIGE, such as what monsters to
make and what themes to use for rooms, is just roll-of-the-die
random. There is still so much potential for using much better
algorithms (and hence creating much nicer levels). Send me an
email if you are interested in helping out, you certainly don't
need to be a programmer!

<h2>USAGE GUIDE</h2>

The graphical interface that OBLIGE is quite easy to use.
The first control is the "SEED" number.
Each SEED number produces a unique, distinctive level. 
Using the same SEED number always produces the exact same level
(as long as the other settings are the same).

<p>
Other settings include:
<ul>
  <li>the "Game" type (DOOM 1, DOOM 2, HERETIC or HEXEN), 
  <li>the "Mode" of the game (SINGLE-PLAYER, CO-OP, or DEATHMATCH)
  <li>the "Length" of the output wad (SINGLE-LEVEL, ONE-EPISODE, FULL-GAME).
</ul>

After you've chosen the desired settings, press the "Build..." button,
which will open a Save-File dialog asking you what the output file
should be. Enter something appropriate, e.g. TEST, and after that
OBLIGE will starting building the levels.

<p>
The levels created by OBLIGE are ready to play.  There is no
need to run the output WAD file through a node-builder program,
since OBLIGE does this automatically.

<p>
You should use a Source Port to play the levels, because the
original DOOM.EXE, DOOM2.EXE (etc..) may not cope with the
architecture which OBLIGE creates.  For example, you might
get the dreaded "Visplane Overflow" error, which is fatal. 


<h2>STATUS OF EACH GAME</h2>

<b>DOOM 2</b>: by far the most well tested and stable game target,
and contains the most number of different themes.
<p>

<b>DOOM 1</b>: has been tested and works pretty well, although it's
possible that a invalid texture might be used by mistake.  Some
extra themes would be nice to have (e.g. for hell levels that
DOOM 1 does so well).
<p>

<b>HERETIC</b>: poorly tested and very lacking in different themes,
and it's possible that some keyed doors might not work properly
(requiring the wrong key) or other similar problems.
<p>

<b>HEXEN</b>: basically borked, can create levels but they won't work
properly, e.g. none of the linedefs have the correct line-types
(for doors and lifts etc). Also very lacking in themes. Plus
none of the HEXEN specialities, such as the hub system, player
classes, and three-part weapons, are supported yet.
