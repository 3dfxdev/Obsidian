WORK IN PROGRESS
================


+  SHAPE GRAMMARS:

>>>   create edges for connections  [ HOW ??? ]

   -  be more semantically aware, e.g. pick areas where to make
      staircases / liquid areas / closets

   -  support mirroring along an axis (possibly diagonal)

   IDEA: 'R' does not create a REAL room, but a proto-room, and if
         it cannot be grown to a sufficient size (etc) then it could
         become a closet or cage or something decorative.

         similary: prunable hallways if they go nowhere


-  titlepic backgrounds (current and new) :
   determine ones for official package, put rest in an addon


+  face direction for switches


!!  some trap doors do not open
    [ door next-to door thing.... ]


+  not enough ammo on early maps
   [ need to check if just bullet/shell weapons ]
