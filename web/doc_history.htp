<h3>HISTORY OF OBLIGE</h3>

<b>Oblige V1</b> was the initial prototype,
begun around May 2005.
It was written in pure C++ and had a very limited architecture
(everything was just 64x64 blocks).
No monsters or items were added.
A notable feature was a GUI window which
showed you the shape of each generated area.
The V1 codebase was never released, but rumour has it
the code lurks somewhere deep in the SVN repository.

<p>
<b>Oblige V2</b> started development in June 2006, using Lua scripts
for the level creation logic and C++ for the GUI front-end
and WAD output code.  This evolved with many features and
support for several games to become the first public release:
OBLIGE 0.81 (January 2007).
The last release of the V2 codebase was version 0.97 (May 2008).

<p>
<b>Oblige V3</b> is the current incarnation.
Severe limitations in the previous code prompted a huge rewrite,
a process which is still on-going as many earlier features
have not been re-implemented yet.
The first public release of the V3 codebase
occurred in April 2009 (at version 3.39)
and it is planned to release future versions
as often as possible.

<h3 id="changes339">CHANGES IN 3.39</h3>

<PRE>
Version 3.39 was the huge rewrite, with over 1500 SVN commits
since the 0.97 release.  The most significant changes were:

* The map representation changed to a completely different system.
  The old method had 64x64 squares (which could be sub-divided into
  16x16 "fragments"), with very limited support for angled walls.
  The new method uses "brushes" like in Quake mapping, which are
  solid regions of space, and can support arbitrary shapes on the
  2D map (and will allow more freedom in the Z dimension).

* Nearly all of the level building logic (Lua code) was rewritten
  from scratch.  A key concept in the rewrite is "seeds", which
  are a grid of 256x256 blocks on the 2D map, and each seed is
  responsible for building itself (floor, ceiling, any walls,
  and anything special in it like a staircase or pillar).

* All the game definitions were moved to a 'games' folder, and
  each Lua file in that folder is loaded when OBLIGE starts up,
  hence new games defs can simply be dropped in without having
  to change anything.  The same system is used for engine defs
  and module defs too.

+ The new planning code supports really big rooms, and also
  "parent" rooms which can contain other rooms.  Often the parent
  rooms are outdoor and the child rooms are buildings, leading to
  areas similar to DOOM II's MAP13.

+ The room layout code supports symmetrical rooms, and uses a
  "room fab" system which selects a usable shape for the room
  (which major elements like stairs, different height areas,
  solid and diagonal blocks).  These room fabs can also be used
  recursively, which can lead to some very interesting rooms.

+ The user interface was improved, with distinct panels for
  Game Settings, Level Architecture and Playing Style, and a
  scrollable area for custom modules.

+ Preliminary support for Quake and Quake II.

With all this work going on, a lot of features which were
available before have not been re-implemented yet:

-  only supports DOOM 1 and DOOM 2
-  only one available theme: TECH
-  no traps, no cages
-  no secrets, no powerups
-  very limited scenery
