WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Monsters

-  later levels should not always have a Cyberdemon as a
   guard monster -- especially in "weak" mode.

-  improve guard_mon_prob() logic -- take control module into account

+  fix monsters stuck in "cave_wall", also doorways into cave



Later
=====

+  intrusions: like "junking" a side, but connects two other rooms
   (they are really just a hallway, but merging itself with the
    neighboring room as much as possible)

+  sky-halls (variation of the above, no?)

+  closets (as in V4 / V5)

+  get stairwells working again, have outdoor version w/ rails

+  apply nice items gotten in normal rooms to the HMODEL


-  reserved rooms: can turn into caves (if large + styles)

-  if few caves (total svolume < N), use same wall over whole level

-  improve connection logic out of cave rooms
   (primary criterion should be distance from other conns)

-  certain cases in DM_AlignTextures don't work well, especially
   an upper where a crate straddles the periph (but does not directly
   overlap any linedefs).

-  ability to centre doors (on two seeds)


-  in 2x2 rooms, place key/switch in middle of room
   [ monster/item spots are the hard part ]

-  outdoor fences should straddle both rooms
   (but need to handle corners and T junctions)

-  wider arches: be good to make them TALLER too

-  ensure normal doors are usually monster-openable, secret doors not
