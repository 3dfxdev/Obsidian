WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Miscellaneous
-------------

>>>  support "sky closets" (require outdoor area on all sides)

+  need a height check for gazebos

-  improve the gazebos / sky_pads


-  assign a floor chunk for boss fights

-  get posts working with rail junctions again


-  internal fences (esp. for outdoor rooms)

-  review window qty



Hallway System
--------------

+  make hallway themes for deuce (tech/urban/hell), and
   review the existing xxx_Hallway themes.

   e.g. BLOOD1 for ceiling/floor in hell
   e.g. SKSPINE2 for wall in hell



Scenic Borders
--------------

-  need posts where two different floor heights meet (for railing)

-  handle stairs adjacent to a border : need a brush for the
   side and a post where that brush meets the low floor



Web Site
--------

-  update Usage page on THEME setting, e.g.:

   the "Jumbled" theme setting means each map's theme is chosen purely
   randomly (and usually different from the last), where "bit mixed" means groups of maps (2-4)
   have the same theme before choosing a new (random) one.  The "xxx-ish"
   settings means you get mostly "xxx" but with an occasionally different one
   thrown in.
