3.57 Merger
-----------

+  fix Pegging: e.g. revert r9750 ??

   (a) uppers and lowers default to be "unpegged"
   (b) make "peg" be a brush-wide flag
   (c) automatically unpeg a 1S line next to a pegged ceiling brush


-  find_guard_spot

-  ambush spots

+  intrusions: like "junking" a side, but connects two other rooms

+  texture for low_curved_stair

-  dark skies

-  logic to ensure Mastermind is added (esp. in guarded rooms)

-  facades: simpler, have a table in LEVEL_THEME entry

-  rename "normal" room kind --> "building" (etc?)

+  proper zones

-  check monster sel (weaker than V5 ??)
