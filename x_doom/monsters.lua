-- Monster list
-- ============
--
-- prob       : general probability
-- crazy_prob : probability for "Crazy" strength setting
--
-- health : hit points of monster
-- damage : damage can inflict per second (rough approx)
-- attack : kind of attack (hitscan | missile | melee)
--
-- float  : true if monster floats (flys)
-- invis  : true if invisible (or partially)
--
-- weap_prefs : weapon preferences table
--
-- NOTES:
--
-- Some monsters (e.g. IMP) have both a close-range melee
-- attack and a longer range missile attack.  This is not
-- modelled, we just pick the one with the most damage.
--
-- Archvile attack is not a real hitscan, but for modelling
-- purposes that is a reasonable approximation.
--
-- Similarly the Pain Elemental attack is not a real missile
-- but actually a Lost Soul.  It spawns at least three (when
-- killed), hence the health is set to 700 instead of 400.
-- Damage value is a rough guess / completely bogus.
--
-- Spider Mastermind damage has been lowered (from 200),
-- since it was creating way too much health in levels.
