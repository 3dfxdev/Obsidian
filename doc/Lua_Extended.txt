LUA EXTENSIONS
==============

The version of Lua used in OBLIGE has been extended to enhance code
readability and to suit my programming style.  Lua 5.1.4 was the
base for this, it had worked well for a long time and the changes
coming in the 5.2 series did not provide anything I wanted.  Hence
I decided to fork the Lua 5.1.4 code into a custom version.
