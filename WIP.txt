WORK IN PROGRESS
================


V5 Layout:

+  support all rotations

-  support a 'max_floor' in skins
   (determine algorithmically from north/east/etc)


!!  get joiners working again


+  Big junctions:
   -  EITHER make C/T/I versions of Spokey and Circle
        OR   create wall prefabs for them + logic to place it


+  mark used goal spots as unusable for mons/items

   -  have : Shrink_touching_spots(x1, y1, x2, y2)


!!  get cycles working again

    DONE:  update stair_flow() with 'cycle' parameter, use it do
       determine stair pieces (and skip some other logic).

    DONE:  handle 'cycle_excess' : create a step (if abs >= 12)
       (step should be at beginning for downward cycles)

    -  ensure 'is_joiner' is never set for cycles

    -  if a locked door is placed in a joiner, don't create cycles
       for it.


-  FAT_CAGE_PILLAR
