-  implement Chris's & JR's boss maps

?  use 'xxx_t' instead of 'xxx_w' in skin tables


General
+  get traps (closets / depots) working again.


CSG CODE:
!!  proper quantization, remove degenerate segments / brushes 

!!  do a proper face-creation pass (merge_face_c list
    in each merge_segment_c ?) and get proper brush
    and area_vert references.

    Hence remove the CSG2_FindXXX rubbish.

!!  DOOM: fix y_offset values

+   DOOM: merge linedefs where possible

DONE: generalize the "CloseDoor" system with brush Y deltas?
      Could also be (ab)used to easily make inset features.


Quake II:
-  need to store wall brushes into a big list (qLeaf_c)
   and "split" them with Split_XY (if purely on one side,
   move to that side, otherwise keep in both sides).

   when get to solid wall leaf, keep the ones that match
   that wall (i.e. not completely in front of wall).

?  use cluster=-1 for SOLID leafs


Quakey:
+  merge Q#_CreateEntities into a common function

-  dface_t == dface2_t, move into common ??

q1_nodes:
  -  floor_leaf --> leaf
  ?? move floor/ceiling faces into leaf.faces (instead of leaf.floor)
