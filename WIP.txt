WORK IN PROGRESS
================

DONE:  item placement too close to wall
DONE:  rare stuck monsters

DONE:  Changelog
DONE:  rework History page for website
DONE:  move most stuff in misc/ --> attic/


Theme system:

+  have "texture groups" like this:

   DOOM.TEXTURE_GROUPS
   {
     STARTAN_group =
     {
       STARTAN3 = 50
       STARG1   = 30
       STARBR2  = 10
     }

     WOOD_flats =
     {
       FLAT5_4 = 20
       FLAT5_2 = 30
     }
   }

   then in a theme definition:

   walls =
   {
     STARTAN_group = 50
     METAL = 40
   }

   if a group is used in a room, then the chosen texture is randomly
   chosen from the group -- otherwise it is the single texture.

   as before, a selection of texture/groups are chosen for the walls,
   floors and ceilings of a zone.  but now, we know that they are
   actually distinct.

   Q/ keep 'R.theme' field?


   rename ROOM_THEMES --> ROOM_TYPES, and allow room types to supply
   their own walls, floors, etc... (overriding theme)

   call the field 'R.room_type'



Q/ should LEVEL themes become ZONE themes ?
   e.g. use both 'hell1' and 'hell2' in a single map?
   --> NO


-  misaligned uppers (due to lighting and/or crates)

-  fix texturing on some stairs and diagonals


+  Unix makefile / installation

-  Debian package




Later
=====

+  intrusions: like "junking" a side, but connects two other rooms

+  closets (as in V4 / V5)

+  sky-halls

+  get stairwells working again, have outdoor version


-  ability to centre doors (on two seeds)

-  in 2x2 rooms, place key/switch in middle of room
   [ monster/item spots are the hard part ]

-  outdoor fences should straddle both rooms
   (but need to handle corners and T junctions)

-  wider arches: be good to make them TALLER too

-  ensure normal doors are usually monster-openable, secret doors not
