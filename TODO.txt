===========

Current Work
------------


QUAKE:
  -  fix teleporters to not dump you into lava / slime
     [CHUNK:dir_for_spot]


Hallways:
  +  don't assume all chunks can be open to each other
     (i.e. there is a distinct path, put walls everywhere else)

  !!  fix chunk alignment in hallway connections

  !!  monsters / items in hallways

  !!!  determine ceiling heights properly


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

+  proper building facades

   -  create "scenic" chunks in unused seeds as part of a building 

+  windows and fences

   -  must decide after all heights are done

   -  need to harmonize sky heights

   -  windows and fences DO NOT straddle, and outdoor rooms ARE NOT
      responsible for the outdoor facade of buildings.

+  sky borders in outdoor rooms


-  pictures in walls

-  diagonal corners

-  secret niches


?  caves working again

?  cages

?  system for texture coordinates:

     u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

     x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
     y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)

?  normal doors

?  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

?  better exits
