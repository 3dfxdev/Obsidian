WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Later
-----

+  Caves!

+  exclusion zones for teleporters

+  better spot_for_wotsit  (see V5 code)

+  outdoor fences should straddle both rooms (right ?)


-  wider arches: be good to make them TALLER too

-  fix texturing on some stairs and diagonals

-  in 2x2 rooms, place key/switch in middle of room

-  ability to centre doors (on two seeds)


-  ensure normal doors are usually monster-openable

-  ensure secret doors cannot be opened by monsters
   (maybe 1% chance)

-  perhaps make 'saw' and/or 'berserk' just be NICE_ITEMs ?

+  intrusions: like "junking" a side, but connects two other rooms


IDEA: for Lighting, use limited set (96,128,160,192) from light sources,
      but allow brushes to add 16/32/48/64 on top of that.
