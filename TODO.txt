>>>  stairs :-)


-  in a large (multi-section) room, if any section has no connection
   and no items or switches -- then give it a nice pickup item (etc)
   or at least a walk space.

DONE: brushes can have a "flavor" and a priority.
      If two brushes with the same flavor exist in a 2D region at the
      same time, only the highest priority brush is kept.

Idea: Composition of prefabs

Idea: "flush depth" of walls


Games:

DOOM and QUAKE only


Layout:

+  rooms with multiple layers

+  Cross-Overs

+  corner prefabs
       - normal
       - curved
       - big diagonal
       - torch in niche
       - jutting out torch 

+  wall prefabs:
       - cage
       - monster closet
       - secret closet
       - torch
       - picture
       - teleporter
       - item niche
 
+  middle prefabs:
       - cage
       - pillar
       - variety of crates
       - fountain (outdoor)
       - a couple techy ones

+  light brushes for DOOM, clipped to room:
   (a) have group of rectangles to clip to
   (b) clip light brush to each rectangle

+  small exits

-  have separate 'spaces' in prefabs 

-  proper system to match DOOR skins with SWITCH skins
   (allow more than a single door or single switch per lock kind)

-  prevent escapes over fences/windows near key pedestals (etc) by
   raising the height of the fences/windows there.



Monsters:

-  use 'level' value in monster definitions,
   e.g. require LEVEL.epi_along >= (def.level - 1) / 9
   (adjust for Strength setting).

-  PARAM.episode_factor : 0 = progression continuous over whole game
                          1 = progression same in all episodes
                          (defaults to 0.5)

+  fix monster quantities, which was messed up by cave code.

   Also need some increase over the course of a level
   (like 50% more monsters at end compared to start) and
   vary the quantity (e.g. nothing in a room occasionally).
