WORK IN PROGRESS
================


>>  facades for HELL : vines, gray-marb, uh...

>>  get 'height' value into 'env' pick_skin() tables

>>>  stairs / lift : standardize height stuff

     _elevation = "short" / "medium" / "tall" / "lift"

     or:  shape = "IS" (64), "IT" (128)

     z_ranges = { {128,0,"?height"}, ... }  in prefab to make it reach target height



Joiners
-------

-  joiners can connect to 0, 1 or 2 outdoor rooms
   (and _only_ one of these possibilities)

   -->  outdoor = 1 / building2 = 1
           cave = 1 / cave2 = 1

-  how to scale joiners for SKY_H (z_fit I guess)

-  implement some outdoor joiners:

    -  tri_pillar

    -  rounded side with stair

    -  fence on each side with brick column

-  implement some other joiners

   -  Y stair



!!  Hallways : break 3x1 (etc?) sections into pieces

+  fix cycles

+  fix double halls

+  fix street mode


-  fake building and fences : support long ones, also deep ones

-  long fat_fences / fake_building : don't span different facades

-  borders / fakers : support 'z_fit'

-  a way to prevent repeating the same prefab in a row


IDEA: indoor closets are scaled to mate up with walls.
      how about doing same for (a) hallway pieces, (b) joiners

-  review policy on "pegging"
   (a) rename "peg" --> "unpeg"
   (b) only honor it with explicit Y offset



WAD Prefabs
-----------

+  check that prefabs can add ITEM spots

+  column with heart (#36) : place for a prefabbed switch or key or weapon

-  lifts : ability to expand vertically so target height matches
   (something like z_fit ??) 

WISH:  mirror (horizontally) a 'T' or 'P' shaped hallway piece or big junction

+  x_repeat should be a skin thang

-  do mirroring in prefab space (only really need X)

-  IDEA: ability to "pick" the sector at a point / edge / corner and get the height there

   OR : use tag numbers for "main floor", "neighbor floor" (etc)
        and can set that sector to a certain material (floor, floor2, etc)

        102 = south (main floor)
        108 = north (neighbor floor)
        104 = east
        106 = west



========================================================================


!!  Street mode : if one room surrounds another one, the "streets"
    between them are isolated from the rest, leading to this error:

      Script Error: Failed to find any height in grid neighbors

    --> detect this, make multiple rooms


-  FAT_CAGE_PILLAR


+  Need logic to decide how to light up a room (windows vs wall
   lights vs ceilings lights etc).

?  have "hallway arches", specified in hallway groups, used in
   indoor rooms where the hallway meets the room.
