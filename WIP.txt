WORK IN PROGRESS
================


3.57 Merger
-----------

-  put stuff in storage rooms and secrets


NICE_ITEMS table
  -  berserk, chainsaw   ( kind="weapon" )
  -  backpack
  -  blue armor, soul sphere, megasphere
  -  powerups: invis, goggles, invul, etc...


Later
-----

+  Caves!

+  exclusion zones for teleporters

+  better spot_for_wotsit  (see V5 code)

-  wider arches: be good to make them TALLER too

-  fix texturing on some stairs and diagonals

-  in 2x2 rooms, place key/switch in middle of room

-  ability to centre doors (on two seeds)

-  ensure normal doors are usually monster-openable

-  ensure secret doors cannot be opened by monsters
   (maybe 1% chance)

+  intrusions: like "junking" a side, but connects two other rooms

IDEA: for Lighting, use limited set (96,128,160,192) from light sources,
      but allow brushes to add 16/32/48/64 on top of that.
