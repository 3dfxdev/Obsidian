New Window Layout:
 
-  initial setup for OB_CONFIG ('game' field etc)

-  mod_box and option_box: send changes to LUA
   (need a new func like Script_SetConfig, e.g. SetModule).
   also need to Signal_Raise("module") etc.

-  load mods from 'mods/' directory
   - setup mod box,
   - setup option box
   - have mod/option boxes change when Game/Mode/Engine change
   - have options change when mods are enabled/disabled

-  Mod Box: shown=0  for game mismatch
            shown=-1 for engine/mode mismatch

?  use LUA code for handling the config file
   (not everything though)


General:

+  create special BOSS levels (e.g. E1M8, MAP30)

+  get traps (closets / depots) working again.

-  Deathmatch: initial starting weapon (None,Basic,Heavy) : "Equip"

+  replace non_nil() with assert()


GUI:

-  remember save path in config file (Win32).

-  make an icon for Win32 executable.

-  ideas for remaining button (YYY) :
   -  Secrets   (would be useless for DM)
   -  Powerups
   -  Outdoor-iness
   +  Lighting adjustment
   -  Big monster adjustment
   -  Linearity


Heretic:

-  don't build Blaze doors into maps.


Hexen:

-  put 'fighter only' bit on fighter's weapons, etc..

+  rework teleporter gates (make them bi-directional).

+  fix key usage (REQUIRE both to get to boss level).


Docs:

-  note that you need full version of XXX to play the games
   (shareware won't work).


Secrets:

-  fix battle simulator to ignore stuff got in secrets
   (push state onto stack, pop afterwards).

-  different item probs, e.g. invuln & berserk are good


Theme system:

-  Room types:

   (a) storage   (crates, barrels)
   (b) quarters  (tables, chairs, beds)
   (c) bathroom
   (d) computer
   (e) library

   (f) armoury | supplies
   (g) processing plant (machines)
   (h) torture  (wolf3d/SOD)


Monsters:

+  put in some Cyberdemons or Spider Masterminds

-  at each room, pick 2-3 (rarer: 1,4) monster types
   then decide how many of each one (for each skill).

-  monster adjustment: don't just increase toughness, actually
   create _more_ monsters.

-  battle_in_cell: arrange it so that cells could be visited
   in any area (as much as possible).  Allow e.g. multiple
   starting cells, "forked" paths (path splits and rejoins)...

   IDEA: treat groups of cells (esp: multi starts and forked
         paths) as a SINGLE BATTLE ARENA.

-  idea: horde_size depends on (pl_weap.fp - monst.fp)

-  cage monsters: don't put hitscan snipers up really high.


Miscellaneous:

+  don't put monsters/pickups/scenery on normal Prefabs.

+  prefabs: improve "kind" fields, allow "x_offset" fields
   default to 0.

-  support keycards

-  put switches on Vistas, eat the special spot or use a
   wide pillar at the far end.

-  plot_quests: if cannot get want_len, try again AND/OR backtrack

-  optimise A* algorithm
-  optimise find_fab_loc

-  GUI: Advanced button.
-  GUI: create menus based on the lua scripts present.
-  GUI: make sure target dir is writable _before_ making levels.
   (have a "CheckDirWritable" function?)

-  idea: LOCK POSTPONING: making a locked door not at the branch
         point but somewhere else along the new path (could even
         be the door of last cell).


Pipe Dreams:

++ better global architecture, room-in-a-room.

+  teleporters!

+  make Oblige easier to mod.

-  bridges (activate by a switch)

-  light up levels (a la quake).

-  exit via teleporter pad or holes in floor

-  improved use of liquids.

-  a mod for Eternal III

?? one-way routes ??
   -  for example: at along:3 fall-off -> along:4
      BUT... how to get back to along:3 ??
      WITHOUT creating an alternative path?
      ANSWER: use another one-way connection

   - One way connections:
     (a) fall-offs
     (b) teleporters
     (c) doors that only open from one side (esp. via a switch)
     (d) lifts that go up (or down) into a hole
         (activated by a switch only on one side).
