Capability Flags
================

no_height	The game does not support floor or ceiling height
		differences.  Wolfenstein-3D is such a game.  This
		flag disables the height-generating logic, instead
		it assigns some dummy values (floor=0, ceil=128).

no_sky		The game does not support sky ceilings, and hence
		outdoor areas are not possible.
