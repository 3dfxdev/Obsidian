WORK IN PROGRESS
================



Quake3 CSG Code
---------------

+  verify handling of cluster node-splits
+  verify handling of more complex rooms

-  clip brushes
-  detail brushes

+  sloped floors and ceilings

-  liquid areas and surfaces
-  sky surfaces

-  trigger brushes (as mapmodels I presume)
+  mapmodels

+  lighting
-  grid lighting

-  texture coords from brushes
-  proper flags/contents for shaders



Weapon planning:

+  make distribution depend in Weapons setting
   -  probably make "mixed" be like "heaps" (in this regard)



Revamped UI:

+  implement the new settings
   -  "ramp_up"
   -  "bosses"

   -  "bit_less" for health/ammo

   -  "lighting"
   -  "detail"



REQUEST:  An option to select "progressive" for weapons to reflect the
          IWAD's pacing would be appreciated"

          "or just spread the intro of weapons out more"


Review "weak" strength, esp. guard monsters

  I agree that TWO of the hell knights and revenants is too much for the
  first level of "weak" strength, and maybe revenant is too strong a monster
  to appear that early.

  Adjust the calculations based on level size, e.g. when first
  level or two are small, then spread the guards/bosses out more

  "It's sort of weird to be fighting arachnotrons on map 02"
