WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Monster Rework
--------------

+  create boss fights based on new system
   [ if boss is new in its role, only use once ]

-  remove PARAM.xxx_factor  [ monster, health, ammo ]

IDEA : "glacial" setting for Ramp-Up

-  adapt the "zone pallete" code to use for each room
   [ apply global "less" setting on top of it ]

-  decide the HP-limit for each room

-  decide the DMG-limit for each room

-  pick monsters to use in each room which complies with the
   above limits

-  kill "episodic_monsters" from GAME defs

-  replace "dist_to_end" (whatever) with something DECENT
   -  a big boss fight every half-episode

-  assign places (floor chunks) for boss fights



Miscellaneous
-------------

-  void up cages in secret rooms (most of the time)

-  get posts working with rail junctions again

-  scenic: need posts where two different floor heights meet



Web Site
--------

-  update Usage page on THEME setting, e.g.:

   the "Jumbled" theme setting means each map's theme is chosen purely
   randomly (and usually different from the last), where "bit mixed" means groups of maps (2-4)
   have the same theme before choosing a new (random) one.  The "xxx-ish"
   settings means you get mostly "xxx" but with an occasionally different one
   thrown in.
