WORK IN PROGRESS
================


DOOM 1:

-  get the compatibility materials in



SINKS:

+  set ceiling of stairs to highest nearby ceil group

-  floor sinks inhibit floor-decorations (similar for ceiling sinks)

   -  check inner point of middle of 2x2 chunk (more if bigger)
      and if it is "floor_inner" then *can* allow a decoration
      [ depending on, um, ..... def.no_sink ]

   -  for non-decorative usage (mainly KEYS), make *them* inhibit sinks
      


NEW LIGHTING:

DONE:  pick base lighting of each room

+  decide if each area will be BASE + 0, BASE + 16, or BASE + 32
   and that decides what kinds of light prefabs to add
   [ i.e. ceiling light fittings or "big" light decorations ]

-  sink-based lights / sky should force/require the brightest area in room

-  ignore area light for wall stuff

+  some ceiling light fixtures

??  for joiners and doors/windows : pick a value roughly between
    the two sides.  E.g. if diff == 32, use lowest + 16
    When diff == 16, use the darkest side.
    Remember to take shadow side into account for straddlers.



WALLS:

+  get the decorative walls working nicely
   [ pick one per area or floor_group ]

   -  support GROUP objects in 'GROUPS' table

   -  the name is always: kind .. "_" .. groupname

   -  support "env", "theme" (etc??) fields

   -  if nothing found, fall back to non-group lookup



GROWER:

+  two connections into a room  [ NOT joiners though ]
