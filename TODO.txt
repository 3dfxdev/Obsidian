OBLIGE TODO
===========

Current Work
------------


Hallways:
  +  don't assume all chunks can be open to each other
     (i.e. there is a distinct path, put walls everywhere else)

  !!  fix chunk alignment in hallway connections

  !!  monsters / items in hallways
      (a) set 'belong_room' of hallway
      (b) add hallway spots into that room's lists
      (c) mark hallway spots as hallway

  !!!  determine ceiling heights properly

  +  proper height setting, use lifts when necessary


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Goals for next WIP
==================

+  proper building facades

   -  create "scenic" chunks in unused seeds as part of a building 

+  windows and fences

   -  must decide after all heights are done

   -  need to harmonize sky heights

   -  windows and fences DO NOT straddle, and outdoor rooms ARE NOT
      responsible for the outdoor facade of buildings.

+  sky borders in outdoor rooms

-  diagonal corners

DONE-ISH: crossovers

DONE-ISH: liquid areas

DONE: void seeds


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

+  pictures in walls

+  normal doors


-  secret niches

-  caves working again

-  system for texture coordinates:

     u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

     x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
     y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)


?  cages

?  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

?  better exits
