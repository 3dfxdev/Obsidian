THEME SYSTEM
============

Theme Definitions
-----------------

Every level has a single 'Level Theme', defined in the game-specific
LEVEL_THEMES table.  For example, it is called QUAKE.LEVEL_THEMES in
the games/quake.lua file.  There can be several Level Themes which
belong to a single 'User Theme' -- e.g. with DOOM the "Hell" theme
will randomly select between two Level Themes: doom_hell1 (which is
green marble) and doom_hell2 (which is hot red bricks).

Levels are divided into large 'Zones' (usually separated by keyed
doors) and each zone has its own 'Zone Theme', defined in the
ZONE_THEMES table.

Zones consist of rooms, and each room has its own 'Room Theme',
defined in the ROOM_THEMES table.  That includes hallways too.

The THEME_DEFAULTS table provides info which can be common to
every theme -- and hence that stuff does not need to be duplicated
in all the specific themes.

The most specific theme usually[*] overrides any values from a
more generic one, with the following priorities:

    ROOM_THEMES > ZONE_THEMES > LEVEL_THEMES > THEME_DEFAULTS

Zone Themes can be absent, in which case OBLIGE will create its own
one using the data in the Level Theme.

Room Themes cannot be absent (at least for buildings, see below).


[*] there are exceptions though, for example OBLIGE selects a
single liquid to be used for the whole level, hence any 'liquids'
table in a Zone Theme or Room Theme will be ignored.


Application
-----------

Theming is decided after all the rooms have been connected and the
quest structure is in place (including the zones).

Liquids are easy: there is only one liquid per level (if any) and
this gets decided right at the beginning of the planning stage.

Building facades are fairly easy.  There will be a single facade
used in each zone [perhaps in the future allow two in very large
levels].  It will be chosen using the 'facades' table in the
Zone Theme, if absent then try 'facades' in the Level Theme, but
if all else fails then OBLIGE will use the interior wall from one
of the buildings in the zone.

Each room and hallway will get a 'room_theme' reference.
There are four basic kinds of rooms: Buildings, Caves, Outdoor and
Hallways.  [Note: hallways are not really considered rooms by the
Lua code, but we ignore that distinction here].  For each kind of
room there should be table for choosing the room theme:
 
    buildings = { B1=50, B2=15 }
    caves     = { C1=50 }
    outdoors  = { D1=50 }
    hallways  = { H1=40, H2=10 }

If such a table is absent in the Zone Theme, then the Level Theme
is tried.  It is a fatal error for the 'buildings' table to be
completely absent.  When 'caves' is completely absent, the level will
simply contain no caves, and the same goes for outdoor areas.  When
no 'hallways' table can be found, then OBLIGE will use the Room Theme
of a room which the hallway connects to.


Material Tables
---------------

Parts of a room will use materials chosen from the Room Theme.
Buildings and Hallways have three main tables:

    walls = { STARTAN3=50, METAL2=10 }

    floors = { FLOOR4_8=50, FLAT1=30 }

    ceilings = { CEIL1_1=50 }

Caves have a single table, the wall and floor are chosen separately
from this table, and the ceiling will match either the wall or the
floor (or can be SKY in places).

    naturals = { ASHWALL4=50, ROCK1=20 }

Outdoor areas have some combination of man-made ("constructed") parts
and natural parts, and hence use these two tables:

    floors = { STONE1=50, WOOD2=10 }

    naturals = { GRASS1=20 }

Outdoor areas generally don't need walls, they are normally bounded
by buildings or caves, or have a fence between a neighboring outdoor
area (or a "sky fence" at the edge of the map).  However if a wall
is absolutely necessary then one of 'floors' or 'naturals' would be
chosen and used appropriately.
