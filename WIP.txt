WORK IN PROGRESS
================



!!!  no start weapons

-  weapon order swapping does not work without zones???


!!  Layout_compute_dists

-  for cave rooms, inhibit rules which add new areas
   [ grow a single area ]

>>>  monster spots for "floor"/"whole" prefabs

???  off_area / face_area  for stairs/joiners should be in CHUNK



CAVES :

+  decide if to keep cave-section system, or just use a random
   chance that each new room will be a cave


GROWER :

+  prune "tiny" trunks (e.g. total walk_vol < 10)

-  prune any areas that end up empty



CHUNK SYSTEM:

-  can also use these "rects" for floor prefabs, ceiling prefabs,
   free-standing prefabs (in middle), wall-extended prefabs,
   corner-extended prefabs

-  probably use these chunks for wall-switches too
   [ chunk itself is space for player to reach the wall ]

-  check each side of these rects, see if side is "dead space"
   (i.e. a solid wall or map border).

   this will equate to a certain shape (U, I, L, T, P)
   and can match prefabs for that shape

   e.g. an "L" shape will allow a bunch of crates close to one corner

   e.g. a "P" shape requires a prefab with space all around it

   WE MUST CHECK for staddling stuff..... oh crap

   ---->  means that "freestanding" prefabs must define a true size
          [ 8 units for walk-over stuff]
          and we MUST check that the size fits in the spot



MONSTERS:

+  instead of "visit all vis=1 to produce vis=2", limit the vis=1
   spots we visit by distance from entry coord

+  create 'entry_spots' for all rooms
   [ NOTE : depends on SPOT system above to be in place ]

   -  start closets
   -  start pedestals
   -  teleporters
   -  direct connections (one for each seed)
   -  joiner connections

+  debug Monster_visibility()
   -  use brushes to show vis=0, vis=1 and vis=2 spots

+  in START rooms, allow monsters in vis==2 spots
   [ or vis==1 when far enough from entry point ]

?  when choosing ambush spots, require vis >= 1
   [ review ambush logic, see if should keep the trace_ray calls ]



TRAPS:

+  for each trappable item/goal in a room [ upto max of 2 ]
   decide whether to create a closet trap (using a nearby unused closets)
   or a teleport trap



CLOSETS:

>>> handle unused closets
    [ A.mode = "void", build walls there, NO EDGE ]

!!  create proper EDGE where it joins room (based on SHAPE)
    [ needed for JOINERS too ]

+  switch closet

+  when shape is "F", move them 16 units in the facing dir
   [ triggered by a field in the prefab definition?? ]



STAIRS:

+  need to support building the ceiling "normally"
   [ specified by prefab ]

   i.e. stairs are generally "floor prefabs", and require a ceiling

+  choose prefabs earlier, probably during floor/ceil heights

-  put all stairs made by a rule (INCL. mirrored ones) into a group,
   and ensure only a single prefab kind is used for that group

   [ do same for "rect" parts of a grammar rule ]



JOINERS:

+  choose prefab earlier, e.g. during floor/ceil heights or earlier



TELEPORTERS:

+  exclusion zone for a closet

-  improve eval_room() -- it needs to know # of spots/closets in a room 

-  when picking TELEPORTER spots, favor closets!



PREFAB SYSTEM:

!! --->  use 'seed_w' for seeds/edge/diagonal prefabs
         [ and 'seed_h' or default is seed_h == seed_w ]

         use 'real_w' for "point" prefabs
         [ and 'real_h' or default is real_h == real_w ]

+  assume seed-rect and edge prefabs are resizable, but allow a
   range like {1,3} for seed_w and/or seed_h to limit the size

+  give all "point" prefabs a 'real_w' value

later: allow resizing "point" prefabs

+  figure out semantics of ROTATING prefabs

   -  if has a shape, then ensure a rotation would still match shape
      [ e.g. closets are "U" shape, hence no rotation can match ]

   -  sometimes want a specific direction
      [ e.g. start pads and teleporters to face a certain way ]

   -  stairs can be rotated 180 degrees to go down instead of up
      [ curve-stairs need different logic.... ]

   -  only swap W/H for a match if a 90/270 degree rotation is possible



CAGES:

-  make railings [ see junction logic in layout.lua ]



SHAPE GRAMMARS:

IDEA: rules can specify a "prefab_flavor" for any rects, and when
      finding a matching prefab require "flavor" field to match.

-  allow TWO conns into a new room (become F1/F2 in CONN object)

-  allow TWO stairs into a new area

+  prune / re-use rooms which remain small, and hallways which
   never end up anywhere else

+  symmetrical rooms
   +  join mirrored RECTS (the final areas) with 'peer' field

   -  mark a RECT created by a "straddling" rule
      [ increased score for wotsit finding ]

   ?? join mirrored seeds with 'peer' field

   +  a way to score "straddling" patterns higher
      [ they are a very good place for some stuff, e.g. exits ]
      [[ only first usage of SPROUT/DECOR needs to score higher ]]

   -  SPROUT pass : try some without a mirrored half

   -  SPROUT: if mirrored and new rooms touch/overlap, only create
              a single room

+  for CTF, create one big room with "rotate" symmetry
   [ interleave GROW and SPROUT passes ]
   [[ "new_room" becomes "new_area" but acting like a new room ]]

idea:  'a', 'b', 'c' matches anything but "1", "2", "3"
       Q/ does "anything" included empty space / other rooms?
       A/ yes it would

idea:  CYCLE pass (after SPROUT) for multiple paths
       [ probably as 'H' hallways, allow these to grow, prune them
         when they fail to connect ]



AUXILIARIES:

-  support count adjustments
      e.g. style_adjust = { "hallways", 0.4, 1.0, 4.0 }

-  min_count, max_count

-  support 'count_tab' with probabilities _OR_ a 'count_list' with a
   list of a values (one chosen at random)

IDEA: have a flag which means auxiliaries must match something in their parent
      [ implement by marking parent seeds ]
      [[ when an auxiliaries rule succeeds, it marks seeds the same as parent ]]

idea: 7/8/9 elements which do not represent anything, but allow
      rules to create something, then auxiliaries or future rules
      can transform that shape back into normal geometry
      [ and instead of "count", some rulesets may say "until X is gone" ]

idea: have rulesets for standard "grow", "sprout", "decor" steps
      (maybe even "root")
      
Usage Ideas:

  -  a DECOR rule begins a liquid area, and an auxiliary ruleset
     is used to spread that area, staying close to existing geometry
     in a room.

  -  a SPROUT rule begins a hallway, an auxiliary ruleset constructs
     rest of hallway, and another auxiliary ruleset sprouts hallway
     into new rooms, and a final auxiliary rulset prunes unused branches



HALLWAYS:

Q/ do we always build them with prefabs for every piece?

-  'H' in grammar rules (see above)

-  treat as an area of room which it sprouts off, but have special
   rules for making them (e.g. low heights, different textures)

-  hallways don't count when checking room size



INTRA-ROOM LOCKS

-  if room has a unlocked non-teleporter exit, and we have an unused
   closet --> lock exit with a switch and add a switch closet
   [ and sometimes "trap" the switch closet ]

-  another idea: if have a KEY in a closet, then use a barred-key-closet
   and add a switch closet which opens it.

idea: a generic lowering bars prefab to go in front of closets or
      joiners or exit doors

-  a "raising stairs" prefab, need to find the switch
   [ hard part is guaranteeing cannot get there another way ]

-  closet that looks like a wall switch but opens a monsters closet



MISCELLANEOUS:

-  titlepic backgrounds (current and new) :
   determine ones for official package, put rest in an addon

+  face direction for switches / teleport exits
