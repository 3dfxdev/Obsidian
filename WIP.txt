WORK IN PROGRESS
================


DONE:  properly support "big_item" spots

DONE:  very basic "fake" building

-  fake building with a fake window (or two)

-  fake building with torches (esp. for dark maps)


-  fake building and fences : support long ones, also deep ones
   - also: allow a 'group' field to match border_group

-  borders / fakers : support 'z_fit'



>>  get 'height' value into 'env' pick_skin() tables

>>>  stairs / lift : standardize height stuff



!!  Hallways : break 3x1 (etc?) sections into pieces

!!  fix cycles


-  fix double halls

-  fix street mode


-  a way to prevent repeating the same prefab in a row

minor:  long fat_fences / fake_building : don't span different facades



WAD Prefabs
-----------

+  column with heart (#36) : place for a prefabbed switch or key or weapon

WISH:  mirror (horizontally) a 'T' or 'P' shaped hallway piece or big junction

+  x_repeat should be a skin thang

-  do mirroring in prefab space (only really need X)

-  IDEA: ability to "pick" the sector at a point / edge / corner and get the height there

   OR : use tag numbers for "main floor", "neighbor floor" (etc)
        and can set that sector to a certain material (floor, floor2, etc)

        102 = south (main floor)
        108 = north (neighbor floor)
        104 = east
        106 = west



========================================================================


!!  Street mode : if one room surrounds another one, the "streets"
    between them are isolated from the rest, leading to this error:

      Script Error: Failed to find any height in grid neighbors

    --> detect this, make multiple rooms


-  FAT_CAGE_PILLAR


+  Need logic to decide how to light up a room (windows vs wall
   lights vs ceilings lights etc).

?  have "hallway arches", specified in hallway groups, used in
   indoor rooms where the hallway meets the room.
