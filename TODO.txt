OBLIGE TODO
===========

Current Work
------------

What is difference between:
   (a) intrusion using two sides of a room section
   (b) treating a HORIZ+J+VERT hallway as part of a room


>>>>>  SECTIONS rework

>>>  Stairs: fix ability to go from A2 --> A1
     (in other words: ability for stair chunk to be in unset floor)



++  some VOID and LIQUID areas

++  LOGO pictures on indoor walls (DOOM format games)


!!!  the "apply twice" problem in prefab build code


>>> stairs....

>>> areas.lua : all room fleshing out stuff


FIX: areas may be separated by "scenic" chunks
     --> prevent that, c.f. sub-room logic in V3


"blend" chunks ? 


Windows: MUST decide them after all heights are done


Cross-overs : need room heights of intruded room to decide
              height of the hallway, but hallway is visited first.

              WHAT TO DO??
              --> if hallway is first, pick a height and if that
                  height is no good, then change it afterwards
                  [need ability to change it via stairs or lifts]



5. corner prefab -- chunk is assumed not to be passable anymore,
   can make the whole thing solid [c.f. the V3 corner seeds]
   or make a curve or diagonal -- anything a prefab can do.
   
   need to make sure that room stays traversible

6. wall prefab -- touches one (and only one) edge of room,
   could make whole thing solid, or whatever a prefab can do.

7. big middle prefab, e.g. nukage pit



>>>  Simple rooms (caves and mazes)


-  build all hallways AFTER all rooms
   (decide a height different first though).


OTHER STUFF

!!  u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

    x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
    y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)



Goals for next WIP
==================

FOCUS WILL BE: room connection logic

+  decent hallways

+  cycles

+  intrusions

-  crossovers

+  liquid areas

-  system for texture coordinates



Release Goals
=============

+  working pictures

+  caves working again

+  better ceilings, some ceiling lights


-  windows

-  normal doors

-  cages


?  better exits

?  diagonal corners

?  teleporters
