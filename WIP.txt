WORK IN PROGRESS
================


>>>  Teleporters


3.57 Merger
-----------

+  don't make "future" windows if no vertical room

-  f_indent thing

-  put stuff in storage rooms and secrets


NICE_ITEMS table
  -  berserk, chainsaw   ( kind="weapon" )
  -  backpack
  -  blue armor, soul sphere, megasphere
  -  powerups: invis, goggles, invul, etc...


-  ability to centre doors (on two seeds), stretch arches (multiple seeds)


-  ensure normal doors are usually monster-openable

-  ensure secret doors cannot be opened by monsters
   (maybe 1% chance)

+  intrusions: like "junking" a side, but connects two other rooms

IDEA: for Lighting, use limited set (96,128,160,192) from light sources,
      but allow brushes to add 16/32/48/64 on top of that.
