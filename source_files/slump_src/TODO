For Slump 0.4:

* Convert RNG in to RadioGatun-32 (my tests show that disabling linenum
  in roll() does not result in different maps at different optimization 
  levels)

* Looks like Freedoom 0.5 has some more monsters drawn; add them.

* Add the ability to have bosses in levels

* Add an optional "Have non-Freedoom monsters" flag

* Add an optional "Continuous HAA" mode where we don't calculate the
  HAA of each level in isolation.

* An an optional "Room count does not affect seed" flag

* Fix arena problem (Maybe)
