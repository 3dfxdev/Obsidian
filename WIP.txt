WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Caves:

!!  fix grower (max_size on dummy area)

(c) treat CAVE_AREA as an extension to AREA class, mode == "cave"
    [ what about the dummy area used to grow the cave? ]

(d) get connections working properly


(e) get closets working properly  (clear seeds, right floor_h)

(f) get free-standing importants working properly
    [ probably use the chunks "found" by area code ]

(g) get SPOTS working again



Grower:

!!  compute a score early, do a check on first whole-seed "area" element
    and do the "max_size" check here too



Miscellaneous:

+  F/R cages: also want mid-bars and/or corner posts [ esp. cages surrounded by liquids ]

-  sometimes have flashing/oscillate FX for free-range cages
