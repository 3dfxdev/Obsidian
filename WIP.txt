WORK IN PROGRESS
================


???  EDGE.other_area (esp. to closets and joiners), WTF   ???
     [ only used for Edge_wallish_tex, hence do a special
       pass which assigns a tex where needed ]

>>>  lighting in caves mucked up?  [ check Ambient_push/pop ]

-    sprouts from symmetrical rooms : often skip a side

-    have a CHUNK_CLASS



Hallway System
--------------

+  support "terminator" pieces between hall and room
   [ STOP making edge prefabs there ]

   Needed:
   - plain (open)    j : MAP01
   - normal door     j : MAP02
   - secret          j : MAP05
   - key locked      k : MAP01
   - switch locked   k : MAP03

-  different styles:
   - a "vent" style
   - a wide-ish one with stairs, like in V4

-  support stair pieces  [ delta_h, like in joiners ]

-  have dead-end pieces ("U" shape)

-  support wide pieces (e.g. 3x1 and 3x3 for vent)
   [ will need all I/L/T/P shapes ]
   [[ can be good for traps! ]]

-  be real nice to have pieces which are wall on one
   side and open on the other (with sky ceiling)
   [ BUT: will need to expand vertically ]

   also: open on ALL sides  (mainly I and L pieces)



Scenic Borders
--------------

+  proper ZONE handling
   [ note : zones do NOT exist during divvy_up_borders! ]

-  assign unused border areas to a room (esp. its zroom)

+  proper sky handling

+  different styles:
   - mountainy areas  (w/ trees or torches)
   - cavey/liquidy areas
   - fenced off pools from V7-WEIRD
   - fancy fences



PARKS
-----

+  proper sky handling

+  height variation  [ different areas ]

-  texturing
   [ in constructed outdoors, don't use natural tex like GRASS
     except in the lowest area ]

-  add a style for it, decide room properly



Miscellaneous
-------------

-  if not pistol starts, use more seen_weapons



Quake3 CSG Code
---------------

-  brushlib function to visit side faces, and if they
   contain u1/u2/v1/v2 then compute the uv_mat

-  brushlib function to visit top/bottom faces, and generate
   a uv_mat if the sides contain tu/tv/bu/bv values
