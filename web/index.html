<h1>OBLIGE Level Maker</h1>

by Andrew Apted. &nbsp; February 2007


<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

OBLIGE is a random level maker for the following games:
DOOM&nbsp;1, DOOM&nbsp;2, Final&nbsp;DOOM, FreeDOOM,
Heretic&nbsp;1 and Hexen&nbsp;1.
These games all share the same basic level structure.

<p>
OBLIGE will have the following features which set it apart
from existing programs (like the famous
<a href="http://www.doomworld.com/slige/">SLIGE</a> by David Chess)
:-

<ul>
  <li>higher quality levels, e.g. outdoor areas!
  <li>easy to use GUI interface (no messing with command lines)
  <li>built-in node builder, so the created levels are ready to play
  <li>uses the LUA scripting language for easy customisation
  <li>can create Deathmatch levels
  <li>Heretic and Hexen support!
</ul>


<h2>STATUS</h2>

OBLIGE 0.85 is the current version (the previous version was 0.81,
the very first public release).
The core level-making algorithm exists and works well,
and the GUI interface is simple but very usable.
The battle simulator produces reasonable
ammo and health to fight the monsters in the map.

<p>
<i>See below for the status of each game</i>

<p>
There is still a lot to do however.
There is no support (yet) for the special levels, such as the
end-of-episode levels of DOOM&nbsp;1 and the end-of-game level (MAP30)
of DOOM&nbsp;2.
Other nice features would be:
secret areas, player teleports,
and better lighting.


<p>
Nearly every decision in OBLIGE, such as what monsters to
make and what themes to use for rooms, is just roll-of-the-die
random. There is so much potential for using much better
algorithms (and hence creating much nicer levels). Send me an
email if you are interested in helping out, you certainly don't
need to be a programmer!


<h2>CHANGES IN 0.85</h2>

<PRE>
+  Hallways!  Crates!  Exit themes!
+  better algorithm for choosing floor/ceiling heights.
+  user adjustments for health/ammo/monsters/traps.
+  current settings are remembered when you quit.

-  delete temporary wad when build has finished.
-  collect all log messages into a file (LOGS.txt).
-  removed the unnecessary menu bar.

-  fixed the (rare) non-working switches and lifts.

<h2>USAGE GUIDE</h2>

The graphical interface for OBLIGE is quite easy to use.

<p>
At the top is the <b>Settings</b> panel, which contains the most
important settings.

<p>
The first control is the "SEED" number.
Each SEED number produces a unique, distinctive level. 
Using the same SEED number always produces the exact same level
(as long as the other settings are the same).

<p>
Other settings include:
<ul>
  <li>the "Game" type (DOOM&nbsp;1, DOOM&nbsp;2, HERETIC or HEXEN), 
  <li>the "Mode" of the game (SINGLE-PLAYER, CO-OP, or DEATHMATCH)
  <li>the "Length" of the output wad (SINGLE-LEVEL, ONE-EPISODE, FULL-GAME).
</ul>

In the <b>Adjustments</b> panel you can control how much health
and ammunition, and how many monsters and traps are put into the
created levels.  OBLIGE also implements the different skill levels
for each map (e.g. Hurt-me-Plenty vs Ultra-Violence).

<p>
After you've chosen the desired settings, press the "Build..." button,
which will open a Save-File dialog asking you what the output file
should be. Enter something appropriate, e.g. TEST, and after that
OBLIGE will starting building the levels.

<p>
To exit, press the "Quit" button in the bottom right corner.

<p>
The levels created by OBLIGE are ready to play.  There is no
need to run the output WAD file through a node-builder program,
since OBLIGE does this automatically.

<p>
You should use a Source Port to play the levels, because the
original DOOM.EXE, DOOM2.EXE (etc..) may not cope with the
architecture which OBLIGE creates.  For example, you might
get the dreaded "Visplane Overflow" error, which is fatal. 


<h2>STATUS OF EACH GAME</h2>

<b>DOOM 2</b>: by far the most well tested and stable game target,
and contains the most number of different themes.
<p>

<b>DOOM 1</b>: has been tested and works pretty well.
Some extra themes would be nice to have (e.g. for hell levels
that DOOM 1 does so well).
<p>

<b>HERETIC</b>: poorly tested and very lacking in different themes,
and it's possible that some keyed doors might not work properly
(requiring the wrong key) or other similar problems.
<p>

<b>HEXEN</b>: basically borked, can create levels but they won't work
properly, e.g. none of the linedefs have the correct line-types
(for doors and lifts etc). Also very lacking in themes. Plus
none of the HEXEN special features, such as the hub system, player
classes, or the three-part weapons are supported yet.
