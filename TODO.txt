!!! BUG: disconnected caves

BUG: switch in cave may end up inaccessible (clear the seed)

BUG: place pickups more carefully in caves (otherwise can be unpickupable)

BUG: liquification of caves at a border can subvert quests


+  use FLTK 1.1.10 for Win32, and LUA 5.1.4 for Linux/Win32

DONE: support FreeDOOM again

-  Cave code: give each cave an 'info' field and make it a class
              with various methods, in particular for mapping
              between seed coords and cave cell coords.

+  more supplies in start room (ammo for weapon, armor vest)

+  get small exits working again
   -  rework Build_small_exit to only use a single transform

+  single (or two?) border seeds around map
   (plus space for monster depots)

+  improve the jaggy edge algorithm (support corner triangles)

DONE: cave trimming: try to avoid same material as previous one

DONE: Split_quad: only for _indoor_ rooms

DONE: big caves should not be chosen as starting room

DONE: "mixed" theme on "a few" levels : more varied



+  review monster quantities, need some increase over the course
   of a level (like 50% more monsters at end compared to start)
   and maybe better pacing (e.g. nothing in a room occasionally).

   Also may need to create smaller room palettes for small
   quantities (i.e. Less or Scarce settings).


-  some basic lighting objects (torches), esp. Urban/Hell


-  BUG: items occasionally appear on skyfences
   - finding small spots ignores sideway extents (thick[])


CSG CODE:

!!  do a proper face-creation pass (merge_face_c list
    in each merge_segment_c ?) and get proper brush
    and area_vert references.

    Hence remove the CSG2_FindXXX rubbish.

!!  DOOM: fix y_offset values

-  replace 'line_kind' and 'sec_kind' with just 'kind' in area_face_c
    (similarly for 'tag', 'args' etc...)

-  CSG DOOM: support entity.light

-  CSG DOOM: fix up extrafloor creation

-  Rail brushes: support fake 3D bridges
                 (create dummy sector from brush's Z2)


q1_nodes:
  -  floor_leaf --> leaf
  ?? move floor/ceiling faces into leaf.faces (instead of leaf.floor)
