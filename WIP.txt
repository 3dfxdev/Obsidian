WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Miscellaneous
-------------

+  railings : max_z (or so) value, support in CSG DOOM

-  internal fences (esp. for outdoor rooms)

-  no UAC crates in Hell please

-  lack of barrels

-  make "Jumbled" theme try to avoid being same as last one



Hallway System
--------------

+  make hallway themes for deuce (tech/urban/hell), and
   review the existing xxx_Hallway themes.

   e.g. BLOOD1 for ceiling/floor in hell
   e.g. SKSPINE2 for wall in hell

+  make some deuce stairs

-  fix issue with T-shape stairs



Parks
-----

+  height variation  [ different areas ]

   -  fix window logic

   -  limit number of floors (dep. on room size)

   -  somehow create "stairs" between two floors

   >>  use prelim_h so that we can do heights from arbitrary start

       [ pick a random blob to start ]

   -  create paths between walk-chunks
      [ everything else could become liquid or fencey ]

   -  ability to make liquid pools



Scenic Borders
--------------

-  need posts where two different floor heights meet (for railing)

-  handle stairs adjacent to a border : need a brush for the
   side and a post where that brush meets the low floor



Web Site
--------

-  update usage doc on THEME setting, e.g.:

   the "Jumbled" theme setting means each map's theme is chosen purely
   randomly (like a dice throw), where "bit mixed" means groups of maps (2-4)
   have the same theme before choosing a new (random) one.  The "xxx-ish"
   settings means you get mostly "xxx" but with an occasionally different one
   thrown in.

-  add "Symmetry" to glossary, e.g.:

   Symmetry is where rooms are mirrored, e.g. has the same architecture on
   the left side as the right side.
