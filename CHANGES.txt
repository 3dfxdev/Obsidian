CHANGES (since 3.57)
====================

* V4 began as an experiment into a completely new way to layout rooms
  using prefabs for everything including floors and ceilings.  However
  this system proved to be unsatisfactory (not flexible enough), so I
  scrapped it and went back to the drawing board.  Since then, nearly
  all parts of the Lua code have been reworked or rewritten, and work
  continues to bring OBLIGE upto the standard of earlier releases and
  eventually to create even better levels.

+ Prefab system!

+ Quake lighting!
+ Quake visibility!
+ Quake II works!

- improved progress bar and status messages

+ customised Lua language:

  - ternary operator of the form: (X ? Y ; Z)
  - continue statement
