WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Caves:

+  need walls in some places

+  non-straight wall fabs (make a few, pick randomly)

-  if few caves (total svolume < N), use same wall in whole level,
   otherwise use same wall in each zone

-  tend to use different floors in each room

-  reserved rooms: can turn into caves (if large + styles)

-  ceiling: usually same as wall, occ. different



Later
=====

+  intrusions: like "junking" a side, but connects two other rooms
   (they are really just a hallway, but merging itself with the
    neighboring room as much as possible)

+  sky-halls (variation of the above, no?)

+  closets (as in V4 / V5)

+  get stairwells working again, have outdoor version w/ rails

+  apply nice items gotten in normal rooms to the HMODEL


-  certain cases in DM_AlignTextures don't work well, especially
   an upper where a crate straddles the periph (but does not directly
   overlap any linedefs).

-  ability to centre doors (on two seeds)

-  in 2x2 rooms, place key/switch in middle of room
   [ monster/item spots are the hard part ]

-  outdoor fences should straddle both rooms
   (but need to handle corners and T junctions)

-  wider arches: be good to make them TALLER too

-  ensure normal doors are usually monster-openable, secret doors not
