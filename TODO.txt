Current Work
------------

!!!  get SWITCHES and SWITCHED-DOORS working again

>>> areas.lua : all room fleshing out stuff

DONE: planner: wider hallways at edges


no 'chunks' array in sections, instead chunks are created when a
block of seeds is allocated for a specific purpose.

Doorways would be a special case, perhaps mark which seeds are
needed and perform all the allocations at the very end.

>>>  give chunks these files: z_low and z_high
     (3D stuff : allow multiple chunks in the vertical range)


Chunk/Area Allocations:

1. doorways

2. importants

3. extra stuff

4. A* connections

5. big corner -- chunk is assumed not to be passable anymore,
   can make the whole thing solid [c.f. the V3 corner seeds]
   or make a curve or diagonal -- anything a prefab can do.
   
   need to make sure that room stays traversible

6. big wall -- touches one (and only one) edge of room,
   could make whole thing solid, or whatever a prefab can do.

7. big middle prefab, e.g. nukage pit

[HMMM : probably need traversibility and/or connectivity info in
        allocated chunks [should not rely on seeds, allow 3D stuff]

8. stair -- these are done last [probably], and split the remaining
            traversible seeds into two areas.  One area should be
            fairly small (e.g. svolume <= 10) and contain a known
            walk spot, the rest can be divided further with more
            stairs  [i.e. same basic m.o. as the nuked V4 code]



>>>  Simple rooms (caves and mazes)


+  create height diffs in each room from chunks


-  build all hallways AFTER all rooms
   (decide a height different first though).


-  "flush depth" for wall prefabs, encourage/force nearby walls
   to line up with it.



OTHER STUFF

!!  u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes
