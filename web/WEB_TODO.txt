BATCH MODE

You can run OBLIGE from the console (it's called "batch mode"), but it cannot
load a config file, so you need to specify the settings on the command line.

Batch mode needs '-b' followed by the output filename, and then followed by
settings of the form [i]name[/i]=[i]value[/i].

The defaults are similar to the GUI defaults, DOOM is the default game, but
the default 'Length' is a single map.

Examples:
[code]> Oblige -b out.wad
> Oblige -b out.wad length=full mons=heaps
> Oblige -b pak2.pak game=quake size=small mons=few
[/code]


USER-GUIDE:
but stupid windows blocks EXE files unless you go to control
panel/internet options/security/(change to default level before you
unzip)

note that Oblige does not merge any third party mods into the
final WAD file, you need to run e.g. DOOM with both the mod _and_
the Oblige output together.
