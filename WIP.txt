WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Revamped UI:

-  support gaps between options
-  different kind of checkbox for UI modules? like "v" and "^"
-  rename sod_box

+  FIX ALL THE CHOICES

-  remove the old code: ui_level.* ui_play.*

-  split gui.add_mod_option ---> gui.add_option_choice



Modding wiki:

+  get template/CSS to match website style
+  transfer "New Monster" docs to Wiki
+  enable wiki on main page



Fix the stupid "As Original" logic



REQUEST:  An option to select "progressive" for weapons to reflect the
          IWAD's pacing would be appreciated"

          "or just spread the intro of weapons out more"


Review "weak" strength, esp. guard monsters

  I agree that TWO of the hell knights and revenants is too much for the
  first level of "weak" strength, and maybe revenant is too strong a monster
  to appear that early.

  Adjust the calculations based on level size, e.g. when first
  level or two are small, then spread the guards/bosses out more
