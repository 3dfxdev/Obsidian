WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Miscellaneous
-------------

>>>  support "sky closets" (require outdoor area on all sides)

+  need a height check for gazebos

-  improve the gazebos / sky_pads

-  assign a floor chunk for boss fights

-  get posts working with rail junctions again

-  scenic: need posts where two different floor heights meet



Web Site
--------

-  update Usage page on THEME setting, e.g.:

   the "Jumbled" theme setting means each map's theme is chosen purely
   randomly (and usually different from the last), where "bit mixed" means groups of maps (2-4)
   have the same theme before choosing a new (random) one.  The "xxx-ish"
   settings means you get mostly "xxx" but with an occasionally different one
   thrown in.
