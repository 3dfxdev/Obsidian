Current Work
------------

>>>  create chunks from SEEDS, not BLOCKS

>>>  remove BLOCKS


+  create height diffs in each room from chunks

-  Special Hallway #1 : surround half the room, entrance either side
-  Special Hallway #2 : surround a corner of large room, two entrances
-  Special Hallway #3 : surround a room completely.
-  Special Hallway #4 : diagonal from one to another (alloc '+' shape)

WISH:  sometimes fork a hallway off another one

-  build all hallways AFTER all rooms
   (decide a height different first though).


-  "flush depth" for wall prefabs, encourage/force nearby walls
   to line up with it.



OTHER STUFF
