OBLIGE TODO
===========

Current Work

>>>  big_junctions table: omit the '_P' suffixes

>>  theme for JUNCTION_CIRCLE fabs



Closets:


-  REVIEW: quadratic monster formula : bad for "full" game


!!  replaceable brushes in prefabs

    +  use this mechanism to place windows and pictures


+  fix fat doors (x_ranges) : QUAKE


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Short-Term Goals
================

+  hallway stuff sorted out

+  theme stuff sorted out



REVIEW: Fence code

REVIEW: adjuster stuff 

-  fix monsters stuck in doors / corners of chunks

-  light_globe and flame entities for QUAKE

+  automatic repeating of prefabs
   x_repeat=192 : means we require: x_size / N >= x_repeat (for highest N)

   allow it to happen with prefab composition too

+  for outdoor bordering, have earlier pass to set the facade_mat
   in _all_ unused seeds (grow existing buildings)

+  BUG: stairs in cycles can be too low to pass


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

+  windows

   -  must decide after all heights are done

+  pictures in walls

>>  secret niches

-  cages

-  normal doors
