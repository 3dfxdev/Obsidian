WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Border pieces:
-  number of T pieces: int(seed_w / 3)
-  fix stretching of T pieces
-  fix textures on corner cage
-  tidy up current pieces


Fix handling of gaps inside caves (at border of cave)
-  always do it in Cave_xxx code, NOT make_border() code
-  "cave_wall" -- support as a low fence too ("cave_fence" ?)


Bridges:
-  bridges : check two/three seeds for LONG bridges
-  have an actual bridge
-  add mon/item spots to prefabs


-  caves: sometimes junk a side or two
   - only at edge of map
   - 1 or 2 seeds deep

-  normal junking : upto 2 seeds at edge of map


Closets and Traps:
-  can use unused seeds [inside map area]
-  can use junked parts of a room
-  can use a SOLID seed in a pattern (c.f. cage code)
-  can steal part of a nearby scenic room [not touch another room]
   especially one that used to be a reserved room
