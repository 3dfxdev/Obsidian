Current Work
------------


Caves:
  DONE:  handle disconnected areas
        
  !!!!  spots for monsters and items

  +  proper floor and ceiling textures

  -  better floors, liquid areas

  -  better ceilings, chance of sky

  +  step algorithm:
     (1) have a bunch of begin spots, at least all the importants/conns
         sprinkly some extra ones too (e.g. corners or middle).

     (2) grow them all two or three times (more for large importants)

     (3) merge any areas which touch or overlap

     (4) grow remaining areas until all walkable cells are covered

     (5) iterate through the areas (starting with known floor_h)
         and try to give unique height (previous + DIR * STEP)

     (6) grow each area once -- hence can use cave.render() method
         to make the floors / ceilings and there should not be any
         gaps between the floor and walls, or floor A and floor B.


     ANOTHER METHOD:

     (1) begin at entry point (centre of chunk)

     (2) grow that point a few times (at least twice).
         keep growing if an important is _partially_ covered.

     (3) select a new point which is unset and touches prev area.
         repeat at step (2) until no such points exist.


QUAKE II:
  +  fix street mode edges (you can fall out of the level)


Liquids:
  +  generate liquid "AREAs" at same time as normal areas 
     (by looking at free seeds).  Similarly for cages and 3D areas.
     Create chunks after the seeds have been decided.


Hallways:
  +  don't assume all chunks can be open to each other
     (i.e. there is a distinct path, put walls everywhere else)

  !!!  fix chunk alignment in hallway connections

  !!  monsters / items in hallways

  !!!  determine ceiling heights properly


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

+  proper building facades

   -  create "scenic" chunks in unused seeds as part of a building 

+  windows and fences

   -  must decide after all heights are done

   -  need to harmonize sky heights

   -  windows and fences DO NOT straddle, and outdoor rooms ARE NOT
      responsible for the outdoor facade of buildings.

+  sky borders in outdoor rooms


-  pictures in walls

-  diagonal corners

-  secret niches


?  system for texture coordinates:

     u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

     x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
     y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)

?  cages

?  normal doors

?  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

?  better exits
