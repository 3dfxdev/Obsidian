TODO
----

-  rename: 'switch'/'wall' fields of a switch (to 'wall'/'side').
-  rename: 'tex' fields of PICS and LIGHTS to 'wall'.
-  idea: 'corner' field for themes.
-  idea: "scenic_void" for middle of 3x3 chunk

-  hallway arches: offset by 32 units, allow materials (wood/metal).
-  choose railings for windows/fences (per quest?)
-  sky_lights: decide sky based on "ceiling thickness"
-  replace 'K.floor_h' and 'K.ceil_h' with the 'rmodel' field.
-  floor heights: for Heretic/Hexen, limit slope to prevent lifts

-  remove 'sc_solid' field, instead use keywords with 'scenic' field.
-  fix cage railing when cage borders a higher chunk or Fence
   (raise fence to cage top and omit railing texture but keep IMPASS).
-  don't put a railing _between_ cages
-  exit "bumps" on floor outside -> ENTRY-WAYS
-  exit teleport method -> B_teleporter
-  ex_tech ?


GUI TODO
--------

-  test if output file (unless it exists) can be written to.

+  make an icon for Win32 executable.

-  handle the Abort button better, also glbsp failure.

-  remember save path in config file.

-  different adjustment controls for DeathMatch levels.

--------------

+  Hallways!  Crates!  Exit themes!
+  better algorithm for choosing floor/ceiling heights.
+  user adjustments for health/ammo/monsters/traps.
+  current settings are remembered when you quit.

-  support for FreeDoom, TNT Evilution and Plutonia.
-  levels are watermarked with some Oblige logos.
-  delete temporary wad when build has finished.
-  collect all log messages into a file (LOGS.txt).
-  removed the unnecessary menu bar.

-  fixed the (rare) non-working switches and lifts.
-  surprise traps: improved placement, fairer monsters.
-  tweaked battle simulation to provide more ammo.
-  improved cages, now at more reasonable heights.

MILESTONE 0  (reached!)
===========

Able to create a map of connected areas, with a
few items / monsters, and which works in DOOM.


MILESTONE 1  (reached!)
===========

a) Planning:

   #  proper quest structure, E branches off a cell
      between S and K.

   #  quests: KEY, SWITCH, WEAPON

b) Builder:
 
   #  create a reasonable room in each cell,

   #  create doors between rooms, KEYED when required

   #  add exit switch to final room

   #  player model: (health, armour, ammo, weapons)

   #  add some monsters
 
   #  add some supplies (health, ammo)

c) Writer:

   #  support fragments

   #  texture X alignment (esp. fragments)


MILESTONE 2  (reached!)
===========

#  working GUI interface using FLTK

#  build WAD files directly (no wadlc step).

#  use GLBSP plugin to build nodes automatically.

#  more architecture features:

   #  pillars
   #  lights / sky-holes in the ceiling
   #  paintings / computers / lights in the wall
   #  monster cages
   #  monster closets (esp. along a back-track route)
   #  monsters teleporting in


MILESTONE 3  (heaps left to do!!)
===========

#  heights: (a) each quest, target height (at end)
            (b) approach modes: sharp vs gradual change, bumpy

+  allocation system for blocks (can_walk tests).

?? larger rooms (2-8 chunks in each dimension).

+  teleporters!

+  secrets

-  bridge switches

-  liquid pools and traps

+  good support for the different games (Doom 1/2, Heretic, Hexen),
   and initial support for add-ons (Eternal, Osiris)

+  pillar patterns: 1379, 2468, line thru center (based on entry and exit)
-  chunk-size cages: center of room

#  chunk-size cages: outdoor and top-less
#  floor switches: y_offset

-  wall switches: place in the wall! 
-  wall switches: "small" mode (32x32)

-  overhangs: thick and central pillars
   ++ BUG: don't create pillar in front of door

-  more mid-masked textures (esp. on windows)
-  prefer not to create void chunks next to windows
-  doors: underneath flat should match front texture.
-  compute_line_flags: more explicit flags (esp. override)

-  closets: 
   (a) fix way closet is put in chunk (remove side field)

++ overall consistency (doors/lights/overhangs/windows)
