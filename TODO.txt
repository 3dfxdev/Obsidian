  Enter the ...
  Welcome to the
  Flight from the  / Escape
  Journey to the
  Assault on the
  Death Awaits in the
  Oh God not another
  Curse of the
  Fear the
  Yet another

WISH / IDEA: levels get inherently tougher to beat over a megawad

flyingdeath's Fight Sim tweaks


Caves:
  >>   CHUNKS: don't build floor/ceil if cave

  DONE:  handle disconnected areas
        
  DONE:  fill any unconnected empty areas

  !!!!  spots for monsters and items

  >>  proper floor and ceiling textures

  -  better floors, liquid areas

  -  better ceilings, chance of sky

  -  create a large area (or two) by merging areas together


Monsters:
  +  in later levels, low-level monsters should be used in bigger swarms


QUAKE II:
  +  fix street mode edges (you can fall out of the level)


Liquids:
  +  generate liquid "AREAs" at same time as normal areas 
     (by looking at free seeds).  Similarly for cages and 3D areas.
     Create chunks after the seeds have been decided.


Hallways:
  +  don't assume all chunks can be open to each other
     (i.e. there is a distinct path, put walls everywhere else)

  !!!  fix chunk alignment in hallway connections

  !!  monsters / items in hallways

  !!!  determine ceiling heights properly


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

+  proper building facades

   -  create "scenic" chunks in unused seeds as part of a building 

+  windows and fences

   -  must decide after all heights are done

   -  need to harmonize sky heights

   -  windows and fences DO NOT straddle, and outdoor rooms ARE NOT
      responsible for the outdoor facade of buildings.

+  sky borders in outdoor rooms


-  pictures in walls

-  diagonal corners

-  secret niches


?  system for texture coordinates:

     u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

     x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
     y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)

?  cages

?  normal doors

?  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

?  better exits
