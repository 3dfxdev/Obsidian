BATCH MODE

You can run OBLIGE from the console (it's called "batch mode"), but it cannot
load a config file, so you need to specify the settings on the command line.

Batch mode needs '-b' followed by the output filename, and then followed by
settings of the form [i]name[/i]=[i]value[/i].

The defaults are similar to the GUI defaults, DOOM is the default game, but
the default 'Length' is a single map.

Examples:
[code]> Oblige -b out.wad
> Oblige -b out.wad length=full mons=heaps
> Oblige -b pak2.pak game=quake size=small mons=few
[/code]

USER-GUIDE:
but stupid windows blocks EXE files unless you go to control
panel/internet options/security/(change to default level before you
unzip)

Size setting is the overall size of the map.

Mix It Up means pick a random setting for each level.

Monster strength is always progressive (except for Crazy mode).
Medium gives you a good mix (like in the IWADs).  Weak gives less big
monsters, and Tough gives less small monsters.

Most importantly it supports custom mods: plop the lua file in the
'mods' folder and Oblige will load it and you can enable/disable it in
the GUI.

note that you need full version of XXX to play the games
(shareware won't work).

built-in DOOM node builder (glBSP).

note that Oblige does not merge any third party mods into the
final WAD file, you need to run e.g. DOOM with both the mod _and_
the Oblige output together.


COMPILATION DEPENDENCIES

-  glBSP 2.27  (this needs ZLib)
-  Lua 5.1.4
-  FLTK 1.1.10
-  GNU C++ compiler (nothing else has been tested)


MODDING GUIDE
The core of OBLIGE is written in the LUA scripting language, and those
files are located in the "obl_data" folder with names like
"planner.lua" and "th_doom1.lua". Because they are simply text files,
you can edit them with a text editor (Notepad) and, assuming nothing
got borked up, the changes will be used the next time you run OBLIGE --
no need to compile anything.
