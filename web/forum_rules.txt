FORUM RULES
===========

1. BEHAVIOR

Bad behavior such as insults, threats, harassment,
or other unpleasantness will NOT be tolerated.
People who give me or other forum members grief like that 
will be BANNED.

Remember that OBLIGE is just a hobby -- you got it for
free and nobody is getting paid to work on it.
That means you have NO right to demand anything from me.
If you have a request, ask nicely :)

Be polite and respectful here, and we'll all get along fine.


2. BUG REPORTS

When reporting bugs, use a new thread for each bug
(don't put multiple bugs in a single thread unless they are
all minor things).

Be sure to check the existing bugs and make sure that it
is not a known problem.
Check both the Bugs forum and the TODO.txt file which
comes with OBLIGE.

Please do not use [ ] square brackets in your Subject line,
that is reserved for me to mark the current state of the bug,
for example [FIXED] or [NOBUG].

In the bug report, be sure to mention the version of OBLIGE
you used.  Also there is a file called "LOGS.txt" created by
OBLIGE after each run -- if you can include a copy of this
file (directly after the problem occurred)
then I can usually reproduce the problem and hence fix it
much faster.  Use the attachment feature of the forums.

When including screenshots, it's a big help to make sure
they are not too dark.  A program like the GIMP can be used
to brighten them up.  If in doubt, too bright is better than
too dark.


3. DOCUMENTATION

The FAQ contains answers to some frequently asked questions
(and some frequent comments too).  Please check it before
asking a question:

FAQ: http://oblige.sourceforge.net/doc_faq.htm

OBLIGE comes with two documents called TODO.txt and WISHLIST.txt.
The TODO file contains some known bugs, and other stuff being
worked on at the moment.  The WISHLIST.txt contains heaps of
ideas for future features (and other junk), and has sections
for each supported game.  Check whether your feature idea is
there before posting a new thread about it.

WISHLIST: http://oblige.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/oblige/trunk/WISHLIST.txt

Lastly, don't forget all the other documentation on the website.
It is there to help you!
