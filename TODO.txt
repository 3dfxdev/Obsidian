Console:
  +  make window resizable

  +  handle lists better

  DONE: make console move to bottom on new lines (if already at bottom)
  DONE: implement command history
  DONE: '?' command to display an expression or table
  DONE: 'clear' command
  DONE: move con_dump --> oblige.lua as 'ob_console_dump'

  DONE: remember ConPrintf strings when console is not open
  DONE: @blabel:data@  : make a button, shown as label

  -  don't keep console_body widget when delete console_win

  -  have a "current table", gui.___CURRENT, default to _G
     when '?' used with no arguments, display it
     the 'cd xxx' syntax sets it (xxx can be '.name')
     the '? .name' syntax displays a field
     the '.name = xxx' syntax set a field
  

DONE:  redefine standard 'print' function to use gui.printf


BUG: some Quake maps have clipping issues (invisible barriers)

BUG: switch in cave may end up inaccessible (clear the seed)

BUG: place pickups more carefully in caves (otherwise can be unpickupable)

BUG: liquification of caves at a border can subvert quests

BUG: items occasionally appear on high fences
     - finding small spots ignores sideway extents (thick[])

BUG: corner supports are sometimes off the wall


+  fix monster quantities, which was messed up by cave code.

   Also need some increase over the course of a level
   (like 50% more monsters at end compared to start) and
   vary the quantity (e.g. nothing in a room occasionally).

   For Less or Scarce settings, create smaller room palettes

-  Cave code: give each cave an 'info' field and make it a class
              with various methods, in particular for mapping
              between seed coords and cave cell coords.

+  get small exits working again
   -  rework Build_small_exit to only use a single transform

+  improve the jaggy edge algorithm (support corner triangles)

-  missing stairwells:
     The stairwell problem can be fixed by changing THEME.stairwell
     in rooms.lua to 'THEME.stairwell_walls and THEME.stairwell_floors'.


-  prevent escapes over fences/windows near key pedestals (etc) by
   raising the height of the fences/windows there.

-  some basic lighting objects (torches), esp. Urban/Hell

-  have a 'functions' table for games, engines, mods 
   e.g. setup_func = XXX  -->  functions = { setup = XXX }

-  cmdline option: -k (--keep-seed)


CSG CODE:

+  improve progress bar code to handle Lua part + CSG part
   (especially for Quake)

+  CSG DOOM: temporary file has ".TMP" extension, delete it on error
             kill the temp/ folder  (NB: used by wolf too)

-  replace 'line_kind' and 'sec_kind' with just 'kind' in area_face_c
   (similarly for 'tag', 'args' etc...).
   Put delta_z in there too.

-  make the [wbt]_face field of brushes be like entities and
   store all the fields in a std::map.
   Have a utility function to find / extract a field.

!!  do a proper face-creation pass (merge_face_c list
    in each merge_segment_c ?) and get proper brush
    and area_vert references.

    Hence remove the CSG2_FindXXX rubbish.

!!  DOOM: fix y_offset values
    (when have y_offset and brush side is truncated/extended)

-  CSG DOOM: support entity.light

-  CSG DOOM: fix up extrafloor creation

-  Rail brushes: support fake 3D bridges
                 (create dummy sector from brush's Z2)

q1_nodes:
  -  floor_leaf --> leaf
  ?? move floor/ceiling faces into leaf.faces (instead of leaf.floor)
