WORK IN PROGRESS
================


>>  item choice for secret closets
    [ differentiate between whole-room secrets ]


Caves:

+  actually make them again



Door Logic:

+  check how prefabs are marked as "lifts" and "doors"
   [ using "kind" is insufficent for joiners ]

   ??  is_lift / is_door fields


-  REVIEW : "rarity" for themes  [ remove it and KISS ?? ]



Secrets Joiner/Closet Ideas:

-  looks like an ident with low height and a light (which flickers)

-  looks like a normal item closet, but opens up

-  looks like a cage in a wall, but floor lowers to provide a hole

-  a monster closet with a secret behind it

-  joiner looks like a secret item closet, but another secret behind it



Miscellaneous:

-  for "big" boss monster rooms, add a big health item / invuln
   [ insert into R.items ]

+  prevent decor in liquid sinks

+  F/R cages: also want mid-bars and/or corner posts [ esp. cages surrounded by liquids ]

-  sometimes have flashing/oscillate FX for free-range cages

-  more pillars in rooms

-  IDEA: build "landscape" rooms as a hallway network, but after
         sprout phase convert seeds to "landscape" and _then_
         expand outwards to hit buildings / edge of map.

-  IDEA: aversion for rules, decreases prob of using rule again in a room

-  IDEA: level_usage, room_usage
   [ OR: level_skip,  room_skip ]

-  wall-detail ideas
   (a) Runes  (w/ fireblue? scrolling snskin?)
   (b) square-wave
