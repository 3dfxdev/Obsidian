WORK IN PROGRESS
================

BUG: place_item_list loves to crap out around generating 5-6th map,
     when skulltag monsters/items are enabled.  -- pancirno

BUG: outdoor border placed next to an outdoor lake -- no wall is
     placed between them, can give a gap for the player to walk.


++  placement for closets


-  entry_coord / ambush_focus for rooms entered by a closet

-  pick a "guard" monster for certain rooms, place it
   (really the BOSS for an exit or near-exit room)
   skip that monster when deciding palette [usually :]
   guard monster(s) look at guard item 

?  reintroduce some "toughness" system

DONE:  use new ambush spots
DONE:  melee monsters : pick spots away from centre of prefab
DONE:  when pick non-near spot : prefer different section than last one
DONE:  sometimes place baddest monsters at furthest spots from entry
DONE:  better monster angles

+  implement 'replaces=xxx' by adding _both_ monsters to a palette

-  in dark rooms, invis monsters higher prob, treat as non-replacing
