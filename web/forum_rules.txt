FORUM RULES
===========

1.
Bad behavior such as insults, threats, excessive whining
or other unpleasantness will NOT be tolerated.
People who cause me or other forum members grief like that 
will be BANNED.

Remember that Oblige is just a hobby, and nobody is paying me
to make it.  That means you have NO RIGHT to demand anything
from me.  If you have a request, ask nicely :)

Be polite and respectful here, and we'll all get along fine.


2.
When reporting bugs, please use a new thread for each bug
(don't put multiple bugs in a single thread).

Be sure to check the existing bugs and make sure that it
is not a known problem -- check both the Bugs forum and the
TODO.txt file which comes with OBLIGE.

Do not use [ ] square brackets in your Subject line, that
is reserved for me to mark the current state of the bug,
for example [FIXED] or [NOBUG].

In the bug report, be sure to mention the version of OBLIGE
you used.  Also there is a file called "LOGS.txt" created by
OBLIGE after each run -- if you can include a copy of this
file (directly after the problem occurred)
then I can usually reproduce the problem and hence fix it
much faster.  Use the attachment feature of the forums.

When including screenshots, it would be helpful to make sure
they are not too dark.  A program like the GIMP can be used
to brighten them up.  If in doubt, too bright is better than
too dark.
