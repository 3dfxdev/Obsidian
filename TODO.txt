credits page : test on FireFox and IE


Cross-Overs:
  !!  heights are messed up?

  !!  problem where rooms get surrounded by a crossover and then
      cannot connect to anything else.

      possible solutions:
      (1) require over room to already be connected to another room
      (2) teleporters
      (3) require hall to only touch two section sides (never more)
          and allow connection to non-self crossover halls
      (4) detect the problem and convert cross-over to two normal conns
      (5) only make them from JUNC --> JUNC (through a reclaimed HORIZ or VERT)
          and allow (in worst case) room to join that hall



!! fix chunk alignment in hallway connections


DONE: big junc: require "direct" connections (i.e. ROOM, MID, BJ)


Hallways:
>>>  double hallways
   DONE: fix height problem, create a chunk in room going from one
                             side to the other (as per crossovers)

  !!  monsters / items in hallways
      --> set 'belong_room' of hallway, add hall mons to that battle


Crossovers:
>>>>  get working again

  !!  put stairs in the mini-hallways  [Cycles too]

  -  higher score if crossover splits room nicely

  +  build the bridges / channels using prefabs

  -  fix hallway vertical gaps
 

-----------------------------------------------------------------


++  LIQUID areas

++  LOGO pictures on indoor walls (DOOM format games)

-  revisit VOID stuff
    !! test for 'is_walk'
    -  only indoors
    -  shaped room: put in "middle" section (of L, T, plus)
       (require two in S or H shapes)
    -  3x3 room: sometimes one in middle section
    -  other rooms: use the annexed junctions
    -  create a 3x3 (or 4x4) chunk and this is the middle of chunk
       (2x2 possible too, not touching room edge)
    -  good for cages!


!!!  the "apply twice" problem in prefab build code

+    support m="bounds" brushes (e.g. for QUAKE2_TELEPORTER)


WISH: 3D bridges can be 3D stairs [relax area touching rule]



FIX: areas may be separated by "scenic" chunks
     --> prevent that, c.f. sub-room logic in V3


Windows: MUST decide them after all heights are done



5. corner prefab -- chunk is assumed not to be passable anymore,
   can make the whole thing solid [c.f. the V3 corner seeds]
   or make a curve or diagonal -- anything a prefab can do.
   
   need to make sure that room stays traversible

6. wall prefab -- touches one (and only one) edge of room,
   could make whole thing solid, or whatever a prefab can do.

7. big middle prefab, e.g. nukage pit



>>>  Simple rooms (caves and mazes)


-  build all hallways AFTER all rooms
   (decide a height different first though).


OTHER STUFF

!!  u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

    x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
    y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)



Goals for next WIP
==================

FOCUS WILL BE: room connection logic

+  decent hallways

+  cycles

+  crossovers

DONE:  teleporters



Release Goals
=============

+  working pictures

+  caves working again

+  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

+  liquid areas

+  system for texture coordinates


-  windows

-  normal doors

-  cages

-  secret niches


?  better exits

?  diagonal corners

?  void seeds
