WORK IN PROGRESS
================


NEW LIGHTING:

-  set ambient lighting for each area:

     AMBIENT_LIGHT = A.lighting

-  wad-fab loader : add "shadow" or "light_add" based on (SEC.light - 144)



>>>  3 new title pics



SINKS:

+  get them working again



CEILINGS:

-  better logic for heights

   e.g. group areas into 'floor_group' -- same floor but different
   ceiling stuff (SKY vs LIGHTS vs PLAIN) and different lighting
   but same wall decoration
   


WALLS:

-  get the decorative walls working nicely
   [ pick one per area or floor_group ]



TRAPS:

+  monster closets which open in PREVIOUS (back-track) room

+  for each trappable item/goal in a room [ upto max of 2 ]
   decide whether to create a closet trap (using a nearby unused closets)
   or a teleport trap

+  number of traps depends heavily on ROOM.pressure

-  number of traps affected by LEV.game_along

+  get teleport traps working again
   do monster depots differently, make "shared" sector based on
   an entry area of second room in the level



STAIRS:

+  choose prefabs earlier, probably during floor/ceil heights

-  support two stairs in a rule (to same area)

-  support "L" and "T" shape stairs



JOINERS:

!!  choose all DOOR and JOINER prefabs earlier than now.
    e.g. during floor/ceil heights or earlier

    then for switched ones, use the "action" in the Lua definition
    as the skin.special for the SWITCH prefab

+  support joiners with a height difference

-  support "L" and "T" shape joiners



TELEPORTERS:

-  check exclusion zone around a PAD works

+  exclusion zone in front of a closet



SHAPE GRAMMARS:

+  allow TWO conns into a new room (become F1/F2 in CONN object)

+  prune / re-use rooms which remain small, and hallways which
   never end up anywhere else

   [ do this BEFORE converting prelim conns into real conns ]
   
   Q/ what about joiners??

+  symmetrical rooms
   -  find straddling floor chunks in a pre-pass
      [ esp. even width for "wide" sym, odd width if not wide ]

   +  a way to score "straddling" patterns higher
      [ they are a very good place for some stuff, e.g. exits ]
      [[ only first usage of SPROUT/DECOR needs to score higher ]]

   -  SPROUT: if mirrored and new rooms touch/overlap, only create
              a single room [ only if ONE conn though ]



MISCELLANEOUS:

+  face direction for start pad / teleport pads

+  monster spots from a prefab : can cause stuck monsters
   [ ideally shrink them if nearby wall(etc) overlaps ]

-  titlepic backgrounds (current and new) :
   determine ones for official package, put rest in an addon

-  improve font for titlepic  [ e.g. shaded letters ]

-  review "svolume" and "innerpoint" usage
   e.g. I think "walk_svol" would be a more useful metric



SEMANTICS of ROTATING PREFABS
-----------------------------

1. "point" prefabs are always a square, and will be rotated by a
   multiple of 90 degrees to face a certain direction

   Examples: start pad, teleport pad, exit switch, simple switch,
             crate, pillar, computer.


2. "seeds" prefabs can be square or rectangular.
   
   (a) if they have a shape, then the from_dir determines the
       vertical axis and not other rotations are possible.

       Examples: closets (often U shape)
                 stairs  (often I shape)
                 joiners (often I shape)

       [ some shapes require TWO directions ]

       [ stairs can be rotated 180 degrees to go down instead of up ]

       
   (b) no shape, rotatable

       Example:  lava pit (floor prefab)
                 sky light (ceiling prefab)


Rule: if we have a REQUIRED direction, rotation NOT allowed
