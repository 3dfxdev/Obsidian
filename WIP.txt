WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Quake3 CSG Code
---------------

+  better triangulation  [ review q3map2 code ]

+  lighting
   + grid lighting

   - mark samples which are "off the face", and later set them
     to average of nearby samples

   - ensure detail brushes can block light
     --> for tracing, get bounding sphere of each brush
         to quickly test if brush is near trace line

   - IDEA: implement "lighting_quality" as different LUXEL_SIZEs

   - make vertex colors be average of a face : value in qLightmap_c

   - ensure sun lighting works

   - implement water/slime/lava lighting

   + implement ambient system -- every face belongs to a "room" and
     ambient value for the room is either computed or specified by Lua

-  brushlib function to visit side faces, and if they
   contain u1/u2/v1/v2 then compute the uv_mat

-  brushlib function to visit top/bottom faces, and generate
   a uv_mat if the sides contain tu/tv/bu/bv values

LATER : reject detail surfaces lying completely inside a solid brush

DONE:  visibility
DONE:  clip brushes
DONE:  sky surfaces
DONE:  sloped floors and ceilings
DONE:  liquid areas and surfaces
DONE:  mapmodels



Weapon planning:

+  make distribution depend in Weapons setting
   -  probably make "mixed" be like "heaps" (in this regard)



Revamped UI:

+  implement the new settings
   -  "ramp_up"
   -  "bosses"

   -  "bit_less" for health/ammo

   -  "lighting"
   -  "detail"



REQUEST:  An option to select "progressive" for weapons to reflect the
          IWAD's pacing would be appreciated"

          "or just spread the intro of weapons out more"


Review "weak" strength, esp. guard monsters

  I agree that TWO of the hell knights and revenants is too much for the
  first level of "weak" strength, and maybe revenant is too strong a monster
  to appear that early.

  Adjust the calculations based on level size, e.g. when first
  level or two are small, then spread the guards/bosses out more

  "It's sort of weird to be fighting arachnotrons on map 02"
