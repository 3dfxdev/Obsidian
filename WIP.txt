WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Edge Stuff
----------

+  store EDGEs in each CORNER object

-  make proper EDGE objects for Windows
   ( since want to support wide ones )

-  make "fake" EDGE objects for other junction kinds

   [ conversion done in render code, but may be better to convert all
     the edges before hitting the render code ]

   -  walls
   -  lowering TRAP walls
   -  steps

-  rails



Quests
------

Quests : start room should be _far_ from exit room/quest door



Grower:
-------

+  when a dud hallway is removed, try again on same sprout
   [ especially if map is undersized ]

   --> store sprouts in ROOM

-  IDEA: remember 'blocked' sprouts -- may be good spots for cycles

-  when a large room touches/cross the boundary rect, allow it to be a LEAF



Texturing
---------

+  texture choice for outdoor floors
   [ Q/ still differentiate between "courtyard" and "natural" ? ]

+  hallways

-  texturing on door prefabs (for HELL, URBAN themes)



Closets
-------

+  really want to add them _AFTER_ large traps/cages have been
   added (and after outdoor borders too)



Porches
-------

!! fix missing posts
   [ need to check if a WALL or wall-like edge touches a corner ]

+  one per room

+  floor MUST be >= nearby floors in room
   [ do it via floor-heights algorithm)

-  experiment with railings instead of posts (want #conns >= 2)

-  indoors or dark outdoors : light fittings
