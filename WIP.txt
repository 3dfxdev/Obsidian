WORK IN PROGRESS
================



Closets
-------

+  really want to add them _AFTER_ large traps/cages have been
   added (and after outdoor borders too)



Secrets (incl. closets) : support not-nice mode (i.e. AMMO and/or HEALTH)



Sinks
-----

+  decide them fairly early, e.g. Room_add_sinks() -- or in layout code
   
-  add "light" to ceilings with a light texture

-  detect the "whole seed" part early (easy: all corners are inner points)
   and [for floors only] give the seed a new floor_h/floor_mat, and honor
   that floor_h when adding importants or decorative prefabs.

-  monsters: should not straddle the line between normal floor and sink
   [ draw that line in spot code ] and ideally would have correct 'Z'

-  probably should mark seeds (or whatever) so know where can place
   decorative prefabs.



Porches :
+  one per room

+  fix missing posts (where touch edge of map)

+  floor MUST be >= nearby floors (ignoring void / walled junctions)
   [ do it via floor-heights algorithm)

-  experiment with railings instead of posts (want #conns >= 2)

-  indoors or dark outdoors : light fittings



Texturing:

SORT OUT : where 'facade_mat' is stored, how is accessed
  - basically, each indoor room (cave or building) has a facade_mat
    (defaulting to ZONE.building_facade or ZONE.cave_mat)

  - for outdoor<-->outdoor, use the fence texture (ZONE.fence_mat)

  - for void, use area 'kind'

-  texturing on door prefabs (for HELL, URBAN themes)
