================


3.57 Merger
-----------

-  find_guard_spot

-  ambush spots

+  intrusions: like "junking" a side, but connects two other rooms

-  room patterns:
   (a) less chance for rooms you can skirt around the edges
       (especially with something higher in middle)


-  get wad-fabs working again

-  add light sources

-  logic to ensure Mastermind is added (esp. in guarded rooms)

+  weapon pref palettes

-  windows in indoor rooms (never tall), esp. in sub-rooms

-  ensure normal doors are usually monster-openable
