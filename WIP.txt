WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Miscellaneous
-------------

+  lighting in caves mucked up?  [ check Ambient_push/pop ]

-  sprouts from symmetrical rooms : often skip a side

-  have a CHUNK_CLASS

+  proper system for actions of remote switches

-  internal fences (esp. for outdoor rooms)



Hallway System
--------------

-  not considered "wallish" (no triangular filler) ?

!!!  for 2x2 hallway, have 2x1 terminator pieces

+  finish the "deuce" hallway pieces

-  texturing for non-terminator pieces  [ hallway room themes ]

+  support stair pieces  [ delta_h, like in joiners ]

+  support over-sized pieces (e.g. 3x1 and 3x3 for vent)
   [ will need all I/L/T/P shapes ]
   [[ good for traps! ]]

-  support pieces with windows

-  be real nice to have pieces which are wall on one
   side and open on the other (with sky ceiling OR like nearby ceiling)
   [ BUT: will need to expand vertically ]

   also: open on ALL sides  (mainly I and L pieces)



Scenic Borders
--------------

+  proper ZONE handling
   [ note : zones do NOT exist during divvy_up_borders! ]

-  assign unused border areas to a room (esp. its zroom)

+  proper sky handling

+  different styles:
   - mountainy areas  (w/ trees or torches)
   - cavey/liquidy areas
   - fenced off pools from V7-WEIRD
   - fancy fences



PARKS
-----

+  proper sky handling

+  height variation  [ different areas ]

-  texturing
   [ in constructed outdoors, don't use natural tex like GRASS
     except in the lowest area ]

-  add a style for it, decide room properly



Quake3 CSG Code
---------------

-  brushlib function to visit side faces, and if they
   contain u1/u2/v1/v2 then compute the uv_mat

-  brushlib function to visit top/bottom faces, and generate
   a uv_mat if the sides contain tu/tv/bu/bv values
