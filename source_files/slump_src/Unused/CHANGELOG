2007.10.29: Slump 0.003.02 bugfix-only release: 
            1) Made absolute minimum light 128 (no fun to play when 
               you can't really see the monsters).  

            2) Fixed bug where teleports would not have a destination 
               (happened about once every 80 large levels created); now we 
               validate the teleports and convert any teleport without a 
               destination in to an end-of-level.

            3) Seed fixed to always have a 15-bit instead of a 10-bit range 
               (the 003.01 code was inconsistent on this matter)

2006.06.09: Slump 0.003.01 release: Changed handling of teleport gates so
            rooms should always be big enough to fit them.  Made it so
            changing the number of rooms on a level gives the RNG completely
            different numbers.  Changed default number of rooms to 17;
            increased range for RNG seed.

2005.05.30: Slump 0.002.04 release: Changed how monsters/health/ammo are
            calculated to make it so a level created in isolation (slump
            -map17 -seed 1 now makes the same map as map17 in slump -seed 1).

2005.05.29: Slump 0.002.03 release: This version generates the same wads
            on little-endian and big-endian systems if the program is
            compiled with the ENDIAN_BIG flag in big-endian systems.

2005.05.25: Slump 0.002.02 release: I have contacted David Chess and
            he has given me permission to GPL his SLIGE code.  There are
            two non-mandatory requests added to the license to honor 
            DC's wishes.  All programs have been relicensed with the GPL.

2005.05.24: Slump 0.002.01 release: Fixed errors in COPYING doc.

            SLINFO LMP now has version/serial/patchlevel + seed

            Default seed is now time % 1000 (1-999); seed can only be
            set from 1-1001 on the command line

            Make sure each level has a single-barrel shotgun at the start;
            this takes care of the earlier levels (since the HMA calculator
            assumes the player always has a basic shotgun), and gives a
            player who respawns after dying a little more than a pea shooter.

	    Minimum number of rooms is now 2; maximum is 37.  I won't allow
            more rooms until I can set things up so maps are more likely in
            bigger levels.

2005.05.23: Slump 0.002 release: Only FreeDoom monsters put in maps; 
            progression of monsters (monsters get nastier as the level number
            goes up); defaults to making 30 levels with dm starts placed
            and no monsters in secrets.  Default number of rooms: 7
            Default seed: 1 (instead of the time; use -seed to make
            another map)

2005.05.22: Initial Slump 0.001 release; normalized RNG to always generate
            the same map
