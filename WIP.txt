WORK IN PROGRESS
================

-  more pillars in rooms

-  sometimes have flashing/oscillate FX for free-range cages

-  F/R cages: also want mid-bars and/or corner posts [ esp. cages surrounded by liquids ]

-  smaller rooms (more variation on size)

-  doors  (esp. for outdoor-->indoor)

-  IDEA: build "landscape" rooms as a hallway network, but after
         sprout phase convert seeds to "landscape" and _then_
         expand outwards to hit buildings / edge of map.


-  IDEA: level_usage, zone_usage, room_usage
   [ OR: level_skip,  zone_skip,  room_skip ]
