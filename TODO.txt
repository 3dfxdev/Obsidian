BUG: switch in cave may end up inaccessible (clear the seed)

BUG: place pickups more carefully in caves (otherwise can be unpickupable)

BUG: liquification of caves at a border can subvert quests


-  CSG DOOM: support entity.light

-  some basic lighting objects (torches), esp. Urban/Hell

+  more supplies in start room (ammo for weapon, armor vest)

+  get small exits working again
   -  rework Build_small_exit to only use a single transform

+  single (or two?) border seeds around map
   (plus space for monster depots)

+  improve the jaggy edge algorithm (support corner triangles)

-  Split_quad: only for _indoor_ rooms

-  big caves should not be chosen as starting room



*  get more games working (Heretic, Hexen etc)

*  support for Traps, Cages, Secrets, Powerups

*  add in more scenery: lamps, computers etc

*  improve monster selection (and placement)


Natural areas:

  DONE:  CAVE: more cave wall @ building borders

  PRELIM  place monsters in walkable spots
  PRELIM  place items in walkable spots
  PRELIM  place purpose (key / switch) in open spot

  -  height changes 

  DONE:  small chance an island region becomes a lava pit

  PRELIM  proper theming (c.f. THEME.building)

  DONE:  "layering" : perform multiple 'grow + render' passes

  -  create two "combos" for caves on each map (sim. landscapes)

  -  trimming: try to avoid same material as previous one
  
  -  better bordering with outdoor areas

  -  layering: if last is "deep liquid", it bugs mon/pickup spots
     (find the spots later ??)

  -  windows facing landscapes : can it be done??

  -  MIDVINE sometimes used at cave transitions
     (probably need a new prefab for this)


+  review monster quantities, need some increase over the course
   of a level (like 50% more monsters at end compared to start)
   and maybe better pacing (e.g. nothing in a room occasionally).

   Also may need to create smaller room palettes for small
   quantities (i.e. Less or Scarce settings).


-  BUG: items occasionally appear on skyfences
   - finding small spots ignores sideway extents (thick[])


CSG CODE:

!!  do a proper face-creation pass (merge_face_c list
    in each merge_segment_c ?) and get proper brush
    and area_vert references.

    Hence remove the CSG2_FindXXX rubbish.

!!  DOOM: fix y_offset values

-  replace 'line_kind' and 'sec_kind' with just 'kind' in area_face_c
    (similarly for 'tag', 'args' etc...)

-  CSG DOOM: fix up extrafloor creation

- Rail brushes: support fake 3D bridges
                (create dummy sector from brush's Z2)


q1_nodes:
  -  floor_leaf --> leaf
  ?? move floor/ceiling faces into leaf.faces (instead of leaf.floor)
