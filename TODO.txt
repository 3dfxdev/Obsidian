OBLIGE TODO
===========

DONE:  fix font on website

-  not enough outdoor rooms

-  too many hallways, and often too long


Current Work
------------

++  some VOID and LIQUID areas

++  LOGO pictures on indoor walls (DOOM format games)



???  the '10 - dir' thing : WHY ?

!!!  the "apply twice" problem in prefab build code


>>> stairs....

>>> areas.lua : all room fleshing out stuff


FIX: areas may be separated by "scenic" chunks
     --> prevent that, c.f. sub-room logic in V3


"blend" chunks ? 


HEIGHT ALGO
-----------

1. current room R = start
2. do room areas in R
3. spread heights to nb_room/hallway chunks via connections
4. decide hallway chunk heights connected to R
5. R = next room, goto 2

POSSIBLE PROBLEMS
-----------------

(a) Windows : are already decided?  (NO)

    MUST decide them after all heights are done

(b) Cross-overs : need room heights of intruded room to decide
                  height of the hallway, but hallway is visited first.

                  WHAT TO DO??
                  --> if hallway is first, pick a height and if that
                      height is no good, then change it afterwards
                      [need ability to change it via stairs or lifts]



Area merging: prefer not to merge between different "contents"
              (especially the purpose)

              slight tendency not to merge into a connection chunk
              [since the connnection will have same height on both sides]



5. corner prefab -- chunk is assumed not to be passable anymore,
   can make the whole thing solid [c.f. the V3 corner seeds]
   or make a curve or diagonal -- anything a prefab can do.
   
   need to make sure that room stays traversible

6. wall prefab -- touches one (and only one) edge of room,
   could make whole thing solid, or whatever a prefab can do.

7. big middle prefab, e.g. nukage pit




>>>  Simple rooms (caves and mazes)


-  build all hallways AFTER all rooms
   (decide a height different first though).


-  "flush depth" for wall prefabs, encourage/force nearby walls
   to line up with it.



OTHER STUFF

!!  u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes



Release Goals
-------------

+  liquid areas

+  teleporters

+  working pictures

+  caves working again


-  better exits

-  normal doors

-  cages

-  diagonal corners

-  some ceiling lights
