Room Fab System:

+ SOLVE THIS PROBLEM: connection not syncing with seed, when
  room-fab is made larger.

  >>> build inverse mapping from col_map/row_map, e.g.:
      {
        { low=1,mid=2,high=3 },
        { low=4,mid=4,high=4 },
        { low=5,mid=6,high=7 },
      }

      -seed 20 for an example

+ COMPLETE TEST for room fab placement:
  (1) fab selection
  (2) size selection
  (3) mirror or not
  (4) exit group selection

  For example, if first exit group not possible, try next and so on.
  Then if none of the exit groups can be made, flip mirror mode.
  If no mirror mode can be made, select a new size.
  If no size can be made, select a new room-fab.
  Lastly if no room-fab can be made, fail.

- properly choose exits group 

? check diagonals too for space measuring

- test exits points when trying to place the room
  (in particular: halls should have at least 2 seeds at each exit)
  PERHAPS: if fail try a different set of exits

+ support making larger room fabs (i.e. try the different sizes)

- support mirroring the room fab (50% chance)

- hall backtracking: if no exit can be made, delete the hall and
  try something new.  When tried too many times, mark as fail
  (which may then cause the previous hall to be deleted).

- "wide" connections, especially ground -> ground, where the
  seeds either side of the connection seed will also connect if
  they are the same type.

- make sure new fab doesn't cut-off any non-optional CONN points.

? connection limitation areas (prevent an exit off one side
  from clobbering another exit off the same side).  Probably
  not needed due to the item above this one.

. require a certain amount of seeds to be filled, build a new
  map if that threshhold is not reached.


Quake1 output:

+ fix bounding boxes for everything (especially Leafs)

+ create faces from stacked brushes behind a gap (cf. oa_dm7)

- clipping hulls:

- texture extractor:
  (a) improve error messages
  (b) code to check if data/quake_tex.wad exists

- create "oblige" and "oblige_neon" miptex using the built-in image.

++ perform lighting

++ perform visibility

  ?? convert portal sides into portal faces


DOOM ENTITY PROPS:

QUAKE1 ENTITY PROPS:

CSG Polygoniser:

-  stuff.... 
  
-  DOOM: remove (comment out) no longer needed LUA funcs:
         add_sector, add_linedef etc...
         
   >> integrate begin_level() and end_level() properly
      (part of "(ob)con" or "csg2" or module).


GUI:

+  pass 'failure' flag to Quake_Finish() etc..

+  ui_chooser code: remove hard-coded game bits (WAD, PAK)

+  reading and writing the config file (via LUA code) 
 
   -  on serious script errors: remember it, so that we
      don't try calling into LUA to write the config.


General:

+  get the 'Unixy' type of installation working, and
   write a INSTALL.txt with some useful information.

+  create special BOSS levels (e.g. E1M8, MAP30)

+  get traps (closets / depots) working again.

-  Levels in an episode get progressively bigger.

-  make the EASY skill much easier (less monsters)

-  Deathmatch: initial starting weapon (None,Basic,Heavy) : "Equip"

-  FreeDoom: some scenery items (hanging gore) have no sprites


GUI:

-  remember save path in config file (Win32).

-  make an icon for Win32 executable.

-  ideas for remaining button (YYY) :
   -  Secrets   (would be useless for DM)
   -  Powerups
   -  Outdoor-iness
   +  Lighting adjustment
   -  Big monster adjustment
   -  Linearity


Heretic:

-  don't build Blaze doors into maps.

-  monsters: not mixed enough (too repetitive), no bosses.

-  weapons: firemace no good for SP/COOP ??


Hexen:

-  put 'fighter only' bit on fighter's weapons, etc..

+  bug report: some doors close and never open.

+  rework teleporter gates (make them bi-directional).

+  fix key usage (REQUIRE both to get to boss level).


Docs:

-  note that you need full version of XXX to play the games
   (shareware won't work).


Secrets:

-  fix battle simulator to ignore stuff got in secrets
   (push state onto stack, pop afterwards).

-  different item probs, e.g. invuln & berserk are good


Theme system:

-  Room types:

   (a) storage   (crates, barrels)
   (b) quarters  (tables, chairs, beds)
   (c) bathroom
   (d) computer
   (e) library

   (f) armoury | supplies
   (g) processing plant (machines)
   (h) torture  (wolf3d/SOD)


Monsters:

++  put in some Cyberdemons or Spider Masterminds

-  at each room, pick 2-3 (rarer: 1,4) monster types
   then decide how many of each one (for each skill).

-  monster adjustment: don't just increase toughness, actually
   create _more_ monsters.

-  battle_in_cell: arrange it so that cells could be visited
   in any area (as much as possible).  Allow e.g. multiple
   starting cells, "forked" paths (path splits and rejoins)...

   IDEA: treat groups of cells (esp: multi starts and forked
         paths) as a SINGLE BATTLE ARENA.

-  idea: horde_size depends on (pl_weap.fp - monst.fp)

-  cage monsters: don't put hitscan snipers up really high.


Miscellaneous:

+  don't put monsters/pickups/scenery on normal Prefabs.

+  prefabs: improve "kind" fields, allow "x_offset" fields
   default to 0.

-  make key doors open-and-stay-open.

-  support keycards

-  put switches on Vistas, eat the special spot or use a
   wide pillar at the far end.

-  plot_quests: if cannot get want_len, try again AND/OR backtrack

-  WINDOW_CROSS and WINDOW_CROSS_BIG: do a height check
   (prevent windows you can walk through).

-  optimise A* algorithm
-  optimise find_fab_loc

-  GUI: Advanced button.
-  GUI: create menus based on the lua scripts present.
-  GUI: make sure target dir is writable _before_ making levels.
   (have a "CheckDirWritable" function?)

-  idea: LOCK POSTPONING: making a locked door not at the branch
         point but somewhere else along the new path (could even
         be the door of last cell).


Pipe Dreams:

++ better global architecture, room-in-a-room.

+  teleporters!

+  make Oblige easier to mod.

-  bridges (activate by a switch)

-  light up levels (a la quake).

-  exit via teleporter pad or holes in floor

-  improved use of liquids.

-  "Horror" mode: fewer but tougher monsters, fewer ammo, darker levels.

-  a mod for Eternal III

-  CTF maps (boomctf) :

      5130 = "Blue flag";
      5131 = "Red flag";

      5080 = "Blue Start"      
      5081 = "Red Start"

?? one-way routes ??
   -  for example: at along:3 fall-off -> along:4
      BUT... how to get back to along:3 ??
      WITHOUT creating an alternative path?
      ANSWER: use another one-way connection

   - One way connections:
     (a) fall-offs
     (b) teleporters
     (c) doors that only open from one side (esp. via a switch)
     (d) lifts that go up (or down) into a hole
         (activated by a switch only on one side).
