Current Work
------------

!!  window/fence prefabs need "air" brushes  !!


CEILING STUFF

-  ceiling heights : check 't' in walk/air brushes 


FLOOR STUFF

>> a less recursive algorithm, once we have decided the floor
   fab and where to place it, its heights are known and fixed.

   i.e. do heights on-the-fly instead of at the end.

   It should be close to entry walk, to leave room in the rest
   of the room for further floor fabs.


!!!  clipping all infinite brushes to floor space

!!   "lava" brush kind

!!   "hole" brush kind, allow straddlers to use them too


+  implement "nosplit" areas, which are like "walk" areas in that
   they must not be split, but which aren't considered to be
   player destinations.

-  support floor prefabs in non-monotonic rooms
   -  connect monotonic spaces with walk brushes
      (make a fake straddler-like prefab)

   

WALL STUFF

!!  forget the "pick minimal, make bigger later " idea
    use room size to get a minimum and maximum size
    
+  determine formula for size of middle SPANs, basic on section size
   it should guarantee minimal prefabs will fit.

   The following is too simple, but may help:

    EDGE.max_deep = (width - 128) / 2   [Including any walk/air area]

    For 2  seed wide room, thickest door is  64 units + 64 walk
    For 3  seed wide room, thickest door is 160 units + 64 walk
    For 4+ seed wide room, thickest door is 256 units + 64 walk

DONE:  fix inner/outer tex on door and window prefabs

-  "flush depth" for wall prefabs, encourage/force nearby walls
   to line up with it.



OTHER STUFF

!!  u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

!!  remove flavored brushes :-(
    (at least from the CSG code, do "hole" brushes for floor spaces
     and ceiling spaces)
