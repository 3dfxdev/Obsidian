WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Room Kinds
----------

+  better tracking of "last_room" which IGNORES HALLWAYS

??  pick first (before selecting tiles)
    -  support 'environment' in tiles

-  logic for hallways? [take the connected rooms into account?]


Misc
----

Quests : start room should be _far_ from exit room/quest door

exit_room : can pick large room with TWO conns but one leads to a small leaf
            [ small leaf is ACTUAL exit, large room is "final battle" ]

sometimes no archway/door ???


WHY force one conn as entry?
Maybe this:
  if conn_set has a ":", THE single letter before it MUST be entry
  if conn_set has a "/", ALL letters after it MUST be exits


often incorporate a nearby RANDOM area into a room
[ allow more ROOM-->ROOM interaction ]


Grower:
-------

!!  check if map is undersized, add more sprouts

-  if a hallway with 2+ exits fails to connect both, then remove first
   room AND the hallway

-  when a dud hallway is removed, try again on same sprout
   [ especially if map is undersized ]

>>>  support 'long' connections
     -  the connection themselves are currently not "long"

-  if first trunk is too small, add some random sprouts and
   continue building

   BUT: sometimes deliberately make 2+ trunks
        (for teleporters)
        be nice to create a big river between them

-  IDEA: remember 'blocked' sprouts -- may be good spots for cycles



Scenic Borders
--------------

+  where an outdoor border area touches X, need a low-sky half-seed brush
   AND LIMIT floor of whole area to be < zone.sky_h

   (a) X can be:
       - solid wall (either in normal map or bordery parts, e.g. zone wall)
       - window
       - a porch
       - a roofed cage
       - a "ceiling-y" prefab

   [ we only know about the walls in FINISH_SCENIC_BORDERS ]

   (b) half-seed brush logic similar to SINKs -- ideally use same code

+  proper algorithm for heights
   (avoid same height of two neighboring areas)

   -  areas touching edge of map need floor_h >= zone's max floor

-  proper texturing (use cliff_mat at edge_of_map)

-  get WATER mode working again



Texturing
---------

SORT OUT : where 'facade_mat' is stored, how is accessed
  - basically, each indoor room (cave or building) has a facade_mat
    (defaulting to ZONE.building_facade or ZONE.cave_mat)

  DONE: for outdoor<-->outdoor, use the fence texture (ZONE.fence_mat)

  ??? for void, use area 'kind'

+  textures for outdoor floors
   [ Q/ still differentiate between "courtyard" and "natural" ? ]

+  hallways

-  texturing on door prefabs (for HELL, URBAN themes)



Closets
-------

+  really want to add them _AFTER_ large traps/cages have been
   added (and after outdoor borders too)




Sinks
-----

+  decide them fairly early, e.g. Room_add_sinks() -- or in layout code
   
-  add "light" to ceilings with a light texture

-  detect the "whole seed" part early (easy: all corners are inner points)
   and [for floors only] give the seed a new floor_h/floor_mat, and honor
   that floor_h when adding importants or decorative prefabs.

-  monsters: should not straddle the line between normal floor and sink
   [ draw that line in spot code ] and ideally would have correct 'Z'

-  probably should mark seeds (or whatever) so know where can place
   decorative prefabs.



Porches :
+  one per room

+  fix missing posts (where touch edge of map)

+  floor MUST be >= nearby floors (ignoring void / walled junctions)
   [ do it via floor-heights algorithm)

-  experiment with railings instead of posts (want #conns >= 2)

-  indoors or dark outdoors : light fittings
