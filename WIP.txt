WORK IN PROGRESS
================


>>>  create PORTALs for all room connections

>>>  create wall and corner information for each room
     -  ignore PORTALS


!!!!  get caves working again

!!!  get closets working again


!!  Hallways : break 3x1 (etc) sections into pieces

!!  fix cycles


>>  get 'height' value into 'env' pick_skin() tables


!!  fix street mode

!!  street mode : if one room surrounds another one, the "streets"
    between them are isolated from the rest, leading to this error:

      Script Error: Failed to find any height in grid neighbors

    --> detect this, make multiple "street" rooms
