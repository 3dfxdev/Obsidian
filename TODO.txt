Win32 TEST: backup file (.BAK)

+  collect log, view it, save it, clear it.

-  tidy up fprintf (etc).

-  data_dir ("obl_data") and cache_dir: find them, use them


MILESTONE 0  (reached!)
===========

Able to create a map of connected areas, with a
few items / monsters, and which works in DOOM.


MILESTONE 1  (reached!)
===========

a) Planning:

   #  proper quest structure, E branches off a cell
      between S and K.

   #  quests: KEY, SWITCH, WEAPON

b) Builder:
 
   #  create a reasonable room in each cell,

   #  create doors between rooms, KEYED when required

   #  add exit switch to final room

   #  player model: (health, armour, ammo, weapons)

   #  add some monsters
 
   #  add some supplies (health, ammo)

c) Writer:

   #  support fragments

   #  texture X alignment (esp. fragments)


MILESTONE 2  (close!!)
===========

#  working GUI interface using FLTK

#  build WAD files directly (no wadlc step).

#  use GLBSP plugin to build nodes automatically.

#  more architecture features:

   #  pillars
   #  lights / sky-holes in the ceiling
   #  paintings / computers / lights in the wall
   #  monster cages
   #  monster closets (esp. along a back-track route)
   #  monsters teleporting in


MILESTONE 3  (not started...)
===========

+  teleporters!

-  liquid pools and traps

-  bridge switches

+  good support for the different games (Doom 1/2, Heretic, Hexen),
   and initial support for add-ons (Eternal, Osiris)

+  heights: (a) each quest, target height (at end)
            (b) maybe a "middle" target height
            (c) approach modes: sharp vs gradual change, bumpy

+  pillar patterns: line thru center (based on entry and exit).
-  pillar cage patterns, 1359 and 2468
-  chunk-size cages: outdoor and top-less

-  floor switches: y_offset
-  wall switches: place in the wall! 
-  wall switches: "small" mode (32x32)

-  overhangs: thick and central pillars
   ++ BUG: don't create pillar in front of door

-  more mid-masked textures (esp. on windows)
-  prefer not to create void chunks next to windows
-  doors: underneath flat should match front texture.
-  compute_line_flags: more explicit flags (esp. override)

-  closets: 
   (a) fix way closet is put in chunk (remove side field)

+  overall consistency (doors/lights/overhangs/windows)
