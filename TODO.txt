OBLIGE TODO
===========

Current Work
------------


Hallways:

-  support '_in_between' for a hallway piece, must occur between two
   other hallway pieces (and different from current piece).


Closets:

-  proper texturing for outdoor closets



-  REVIEW: quadratic monster formula : bad for "full" game


!!  replaceable brushes in prefabs

    +  use this mechanism to place windows and pictures


+  BUG: stairs in cycles can be too low to pass

+  fix fat doors (x_ranges) : QUAKE


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Short-Term Goals
================

+  hallway stuff sorted out

+  theme stuff sorted out



REVIEW: Fence code

REVIEW: adjuster stuff 

-  fix for ugly sky in outdoor room near a hallway
   (mark those seeds, detect in from_edge pass)

-  fix monsters stuck in doors / corners of chunks

-  light_globe and flame entities for QUAKE

-  automatically create bridges over channels

+  automatic repeating of prefabs
   x_repeat=192 : means we require: x_size / N >= x_repeat (for highest N)

   allow it to happen with prefab composition too

Idea: for outdoor bordering, have earlier pass to set the facade_mat
      in _all_ unused seeds (grow existing buildings)


WISH: outdoor hallways (wall on one side, fence on other side, sky top)
      [may be easier to convert hallway into a room]
      hard part: ensuring such a hallway stays above nearby room(s)
      hmmm, could also work bordering an _indoor_ room (no sky)

Theme System:

-  proper room themes for QUAKE

-  QUAKE II


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

+  windows

   -  must decide after all heights are done

+  pictures in walls

-  secret niches

-  cages

-  normal doors

-  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

-  better exits
