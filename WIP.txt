WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Edge Stuff
----------

-  make proper EDGE objects for Windows
   ( since want to support wide ones )

-  make "fake" EDGE objects for other junction kinds

   [ conversion done in render code, but may be better to convert all
     the edges before hitting the render code ]

   -  walls
   -  lowering TRAP walls
   -  steps

-  rails



Room Kinds
----------

-  logic for hallways [take the connected rooms into account]

   -  if one side is cave, hallway might be cave, never otherwise

   -  if one side is outdoor, hallway might be outdoor, rarely otherwise

      B + B : 10% outdoor,  0% porch
      B + O : 20% outdoor, 10% porch 
      O + O : 40% outdoor, 20% porch


Misc
----

Quests : start room should be _far_ from exit room/quest door

exit_room : can pick large room with TWO conns but one leads to a small leaf
            [ small leaf is ACTUAL exit, large room is "final battle" ]

sometimes no archway/door ???


sometimes incorporate a nearby RANDOM area into a room
[ allow more ROOM-->ROOM interaction ]
-  indoor/cave rooms can swallow areas which touch edge of map


Grower:
-------

NO:  split connections : a small chance of breaking into two sprouts
     (just have more conns and conn-sets)

IDEA : associate all non-room areas with a nearby room
       [ if the room is outdoor, so are the areas ]

?? if a hallway with 2+ exits fails to connect both, then remove first
   room AND the hallway

-  when a dud hallway is removed, try again on same sprout
   [ especially if map is undersized ]

-  support 'symmetry' style for tiles

-  if first trunk is too small, add some random sprouts and
   continue building

   BUT: sometimes deliberately make 2+ trunks
        (for teleporters)
        be nice to create a big river between them

-  IDEA: remember 'blocked' sprouts -- may be good spots for cycles

-  when a large room touches/cross the boundary rect, allow it to be a LEAF


-  CTF : start with a tile designed for CTF mode, placed in middle of map,
         and when adding a room/hall then also add its sister room
         [ if sister fails, kill the brother ]


Teleporter IDEA : grow one large trunk, then pick a hallway (or room) to remove


IDEA : a "vis-zone" or "vis-divider" -- independent of theme-zones.
ALSO : "mon-zone" for monster/weapon palette changes



Scenic Borders
--------------

+  where an outdoor border area touches X, need a low-sky half-seed brush
   AND LIMIT floor of whole area to be < zone.sky_h

   (a) X can be:
       - solid wall (either in normal map or bordery parts, e.g. zone wall)
       - window
       - a porch
       - a roofed cage
       - a "ceiling-y" prefab

   [ we only know about the walls in FINISH_SCENIC_BORDERS ]

   (b) half-seed brush logic similar to SINKs -- ideally use same code

+  proper algorithm for heights
   (avoid same height of two neighboring areas)

   -  areas touching edge of map need floor_h >= zone's max floor

-  proper texturing (use cliff_mat at edge_of_map)

-  get WATER mode working again



Texturing
---------

SORT OUT : where 'facade_mat' is stored, how is accessed
  - basically, each indoor room (cave or building) has a facade_mat
    (defaulting to ZONE.building_facade or ZONE.cave_mat)

  DONE: for outdoor<-->outdoor, use the fence texture (ZONE.fence_mat)

  ??? for void, use area 'kind'

+  textures for outdoor floors
   [ Q/ still differentiate between "courtyard" and "natural" ? ]

+  hallways

-  texturing on door prefabs (for HELL, URBAN themes)



Closets
-------

+  really want to add them _AFTER_ large traps/cages have been
   added (and after outdoor borders too)




Porches :
+  one per room

+  fix missing posts (where touch edge of map)

+  floor MUST be >= nearby floors (ignoring void / walled junctions)
   [ do it via floor-heights algorithm)

-  experiment with railings instead of posts (want #conns >= 2)

-  indoors or dark outdoors : light fittings
