Capability Flags
================

no_height	The game does not support floor or ceiling height
		differences.  Wolfenstein-3D is such a game.  This
		flag disables the height-generating logic, instead
		it assigns some dummy values (floor=0, ceil=128).

no_sky		The game does not support sky ceilings, and hence
		outdoor areas are not possible.

one_lock_tex	There is only one locked door texture, and the
		only variation is between N/S and E/W directions,
		hence this flag causes a strong preference for
		two locked doors in the level to have perpendicular
		directions (and hence look different).

elevator_exit	The exit room is always a small elevator, and
		ideally the entry connection is E/W direction.
