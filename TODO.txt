OBLIGE TODO
===========

Current Work
------------

+  Hexen stuff:
   
   !!  proper gates between hub levels

   DONE:  weapons for fight simulator

   -  prevent key re-use : distribute remaining keys amongst levels


Prefab placement:             Example:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
   1. whole chunk             small exit room
   2. whole floor             stair case
   3. whole ceiling           sky light
   4. whole edge              wall, picture, window, item niche
   5. whole corner            diagonal corner

   6. middle of chunk         pillar
   7. middle of floor         pedestal, fountain, crate
   8. middle of ceiling       ceiling detail
   9. middle of wall          quake button, spike shooter

  10. other                   3D bridge


-  position-based monster ordering 


!!!!  fix the "no spot for wotsit" error
   -  make room widths have minimum of 3



Hallways:
  !!  monsters / items in hallways
      --> set 'belong_room' of hallway, add hall mons to that battle

  !!  fix chunk alignment in hallway connections

  +  proper height setting, use lifts when necessary


Cross-Overs:
  !!  heights are messed up?

  !!  problem where rooms get surrounded by a crossover and then
      cannot connect to anything else.

      possible solutions:
 >>   (1) require over room to already be connected to another room
      (2) teleporters
      (3) require hall to only touch two section sides (never more)
          and allow connection to non-self crossover halls
      (4) detect the problem and convert cross-over to two normal conns
          [or detect and turn crossed room into a scenic lava pit]
>>>>  (5) only make them from JUNC --> JUNC (through a reclaimed HORIZ or VERT)
          and allow (in worst case) room to join that hall.
          ALSO: support crossing 3 sections [if seeds <= 5]
          ALSO 2: corner crossing (90 degree turn)
                  can "allocate" the JUNC and create two crossover chunks

  WISH: ability to cross-over same room twice in single hall
        [even from a single junction]

  +  build the bridges / channels using prefabs

  -  sometimes make a dramatic height difference

  -  fix hallway vertical gaps


Street Mode:
DONE: limit to once per episode (higher prob in secret level)

  +  limit number of locked rooms:
     (a) if too many rooms, merge some
     (b) make some rooms be optional (storehouses or weapon)
     (c) connect some rooms via 3D bridges
  
  -  fix the sky glitch (pieces jutting inside a room)

  -  allow some buildings (especially at corners) to eat the edge

  -  better looking "streets" (via prefabs and SKINs)

  -  fix the "big junc" situation, good place for a fountain

  -  a raised outdoory room might be cool

  -  30% of the time  : keep the outer ring
     30% of the time  : expand all rooms into outer ring
     rest of the time : expand corner rooms 50%, side rooms 30%


-----------------------------------------------------------------


WISH: 3D bridges can be 3D stairs [relax area touching rule]



FIX: areas may be separated by "scenic" chunks
     --> prevent that, c.f. sub-room logic in V3


Windows: MUST decide them after all heights are done



5. corner prefab -- chunk is assumed not to be passable anymore,
   can make the whole thing solid [c.f. the V3 corner seeds]
   or make a curve or diagonal -- anything a prefab can do.
   
   need to make sure that room stays traversible

6. wall prefab -- touches one (and only one) edge of room,
   could make whole thing solid, or whatever a prefab can do.

7. big middle prefab, e.g. nukage pit



>>>  Simple rooms (caves and mazes)



OTHER STUFF

!!  u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

    x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
    y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Goals for next WIP
==================

+  crossovers

+  proper building facades

+  windows and fences

-  sky borders in outdoor rooms

+  system for texture coordinates


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

+  working pictures

+  caves working again

+  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

+  liquid areas


-  normal doors

-  cages

-  secret niches


?  better exits

?  diagonal corners

?  void seeds
