<h1>Oblige Level Generator</h1>

by Andrew Apted. &nbsp; September 2006


<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

Oblige is a random level generator for the following games:
DOOM 1, DOOM 2, Heretic 1 and Hexen 1.
These games all share the same basic level structure.

<p>
Oblige will have the following features which set it apart
from existing programs
(like <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/slige/">SLIGE</a> by David Chess)

<ul>
  <li>higher quality levels (e.g. outdoor areas!),
  <li>easy to use GUI interface (no messing with command lines),
  <li>built-in node builder, so the created levels are ready to play!
  <li>uses the Lua scripting language for easy customisation and experimentation.
  <li>can create Deathmatch levels,
  <li>Heretic and Hexen support!
</ul>


<h2>STATUS</h2>

Oblige is still under development, but is getting close to the first
public release.
The core level-making algorithm exists and works quite well,
and the GUI is mostly usable (still missing some bells and
whistles).
Heretic and Hexen support has been started, but needs a lot
more work, and hence they won't be available in the first release.
