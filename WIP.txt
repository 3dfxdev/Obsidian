WORK IN PROGRESS
================


-  test if Spiderdemons get added with "A Few Maps" length wads


Revamped UI:

!!  some of the stuff belongs in STYLES table
    Q/ can we improve how that happens?
    A/ yes, detect name 'xxx' in STYLES is used in OB_CONFIG

-  program option for twiddling choices via MouseWheel
   [ default to OFF ]

-  warnings about "no such module" (for AddOption, etc)

??  merge Extra Settings + Level Control ??

-  check Config_Flow.txt is still valid

+  control MODE and LENGTH buttons from Lua



Modding wiki:

+  get template/CSS to match website style
+  transfer "New Monster" docs to Wiki
+  enable wiki on main page



Make it easier to share a particular config+seed combo



Fix the stupid "As Original" logic



REQUEST:  An option to select "progressive" for weapons to reflect the
          IWAD's pacing would be appreciated"

          "or just spread the intro of weapons out more"


Review "weak" strength, esp. guard monsters

  I agree that TWO of the hell knights and revenants is too much for the
  first level of "weak" strength, and maybe revenant is too strong a monster
  to appear that early.

  Adjust the calculations based on level size, e.g. when first
  level or two are small, then spread the guards/bosses out more
