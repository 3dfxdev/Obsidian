OBLIGE 3.47 Read-Me
===================

by Andrew Apted.   September 2009


INTRODUCTION

  OBLIGE is a random level generator for various classic FPS
  games, such as DOOM and DOOM II (with more in development).
  The goal is to produce good levels which are fun to play.

  The planned features are:

    * higher quality levels, e.g. outdoor areas!
    * easy to use GUI interface (no messing with command lines)
    * built-in node builder, so the levels are ready to play
    * uses the LUA scripting language for easy customisation
    * can create Deathmatch levels
    * Heretic and Hexen support!

  For complete information (much more than in this README)
