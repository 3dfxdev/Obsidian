TODO
====

-  Medium strength: if get rocket/bfg -> monsters too tough

-  review monster_prefs in themes (actually used yet?)
-  use LEVEL.skip_monsters rather than monster_prefs

+  Quests : add locks (new arenas) even when have no keys

-  rarity for bfg10k and railgun for Skulltag

-  more ammo in starting room  (biggest pack for starting weapon or bullets)

>> Compilation notes !!


+  get more games working (Heretic, Hexen etc)

+  more themes for DOOM (Urban, Hell)

+  support for Traps, Cages, Secrets, Powerups

+  add in more scenery: lamps, computers etc


-  implement more of Chris's and Johnny's boss maps

-  rework Build_small_exit to only use a single transform,

-  BUG: lowering item pedestals can go into ceiling

-  BUG: items occasionally appear on skyfences
   - finding small spots ignores sideway extents (thick[])

-  BUG: outdoor bars can sometimes be jumped over.
   --> make them higher _or_ another switch to lower them.

?  use 'xxx_t' instead of 'xxx_w' in skin tables


CSG CODE:

!!!! DOOM: build sidedefs/linedefs in memory !!!!

!!  proper quantization, remove degenerate segments / brushes 

!!  do a proper face-creation pass (merge_face_c list
    in each merge_segment_c ?) and get proper brush
    and area_vert references.

    Hence remove the CSG2_FindXXX rubbish.

!!  DOOM: fix y_offset values

+   DOOM: merge linedefs where possible


Quake II:
-  need to store wall brushes into a big list (qLeaf_c)
   and "split" them with Split_XY (if purely on one side,
   move to that side, otherwise keep in both sides).

   when get to solid wall leaf, keep the ones that match
   that wall (i.e. not completely in front of wall).

?  use cluster=-1 for SOLID leafs


Quakey:
+  merge Q#_CreateEntities into a common function

-  dface_t == dface2_t, move into common ??

q1_nodes:
  -  floor_leaf --> leaf
  ?? move floor/ceiling faces into leaf.faces (instead of leaf.floor)
