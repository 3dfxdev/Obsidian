QUESTS
======

A "quest" is a group of connected rooms, having one or more "targets"
(rooms the player needs to visit, typically containing an important goal
like getting a key or exiting the level).  The exit from a quest is
always a target.

A quest also contains an entry room (only exception is that the start
room of the level may not be decided until after all the quests have
been made -- so during this phase, the first quest will be without any
starting room).

Any quest can potentially be divided into two quests, by locking one of
the connections between two of its rooms and adding the solution(s) to
some unused leaf room(s) in the first half.  The solution room(s) and
exit of first half become targets of that half.

One important requirement for dividing a quest is that the second
half contains at least one of the original targets (especially a
solution target).  We also require that the first half contains the
entry room of the original quest (if any).

This system can handle a door which requires multiple keys to open
it, or a staircase which is only fully traversible when multiple
switches have been pressed.  We simply add the extra keys as targets
of the first half of the divided quest.  [ We also need to check
that the first half has enough unused leaf rooms ]



ZONES
=====

A "zone" is a group of quests.  Main point of zones is to subdivide the
whole map into a few distinct regions (typically three or four, but
possibly just one).

Zones are usually separated by KEYED doors, and each zone is also meant
to have a distinctive look, e.g. each one has a different facade for
buildings, different room and hallway themes, even a different monster
palette.



CYCLES
======

A "cycle" is an alternative path between two rooms of the map.
These alternative paths are created after all the quests / zones have
been decided, because cycles can only be made between two rooms of the
same quest.
