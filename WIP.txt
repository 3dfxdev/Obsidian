WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Caves:

!!! get SPOTS working again

+  review all cave themes [ some are FUGLY! ]
   also want more variety, e.g. ROCKRED in Urban/Tech theme

-  ensure ceiling brush gets same "light_add" as floor brush
   [ OR: use Ambient_push / pop.... ]

-  some smaller / different stalagmites
   [ for floor-to-ceiling ones, use _FLOOR or _CEIL, never _WALL ]



Miscellaneous:

+  joiner facades STILL borked
   [ perhaps they can have TWO facades ?? ]

+  generally improve facade assignment
