Edge Stuff
----------

-  make proper EDGE objects for Windows
   ( since want to support wide ones )

-  make "fake" EDGE objects for other junction kinds

     the edges before hitting the render code ]

   -  walls
   -  lowering TRAP walls
   -  steps

-  rails



Porches
-------

   [ need to check if a WALL or wall-like edge touches a corner ]
