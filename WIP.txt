WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Revamped UI:

+  implement the new settings
   -  "ramp_up"
   -  "bosses"

   -  "bit_less" for health/ammo
   -  "rare" and "heaps" for items

   -  change weapon logic to "spreading out-ness" (tm)

   -  "lighting"
   -  "detail"



Modding wiki:

+  check Wiki in different browsers & OSes



REQUEST:  An option to select "progressive" for weapons to reflect the
          IWAD's pacing would be appreciated"

          "or just spread the intro of weapons out more"


Review "weak" strength, esp. guard monsters

  I agree that TWO of the hell knights and revenants is too much for the
  first level of "weak" strength, and maybe revenant is too strong a monster
  to appear that early.

  Adjust the calculations based on level size, e.g. when first
  level or two are small, then spread the guards/bosses out more
