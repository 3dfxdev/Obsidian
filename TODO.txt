Current Work
------------

TEST: hyperlink code in Windows


Theme System:

!!!  split current room themes into smaller ones


Hallways:
>>>> don't assume all chunks can be open to each other
     (i.e. there is a distinct path, put walls everywhere else)

>>>>>> fix chunk alignment in hallway connections

DONE:  proper chunk size (in other side) when one side is a JUNCTION

  !!  monsters / items in hallways

  !!!  determine ceiling heights properly

DONE: get double halls working again

  -  get big junctions working again

  -  get "merging" of one hallway into another working again

  -  ability to merge the section of a "simple" hallway into
     one of the rooms [especially to make a "Porch"].


Caves:
  !!!!  fix spurious diagonals (at corners of room)

  !!!!  use "shrinky" mode for steps too

        ALGORITHM: for each cell which shrinks (including solid walls)
                   find a floor cell to use.  Add that cell into floor
                   _BUT_ ensure that it never shrinks itself.

  >>  newbie_map  : generate separate pass, check for <= 0 cells

  DONE:  CHUNKS: don't build floor/ceil if cave
  DONE:  handle disconnected areas
  DONE:  fill any unconnected empty areas
  DONE:  optimise touch_chunk with bbox check

  !!!!  spots for monsters and items

  >>>  get the diagonalisation working again (on FLOORS too)

  !!  determine touching lists

  >>  proper floor and ceiling textures

  -  better floors, liquid areas

  -  better ceilings, chance of sky

  -  create a large area (or two) by merging areas together
     [OR: pre-allocate a large chunk / reclaimed junction]

  DONE:  QUAKE: avoid caves for intermission camera



REVIEW: how strength setting affects monster room palettes


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Next WIP Goals
==============

+  hallway stuff sorted out

+  cave stuff sorted out

+  theme stuff sorted out


+  proper building facades

   -  create "scenic" chunks in unused seeds as part of a building 

   -  narrowify floor and ceiling parts next to a wall

+  windows and fences

   -  must decide after all heights are done

   -  need to harmonize sky heights

   -  windows and fences DO NOT straddle, and outdoor rooms ARE NOT
      responsible for the outdoor facade of buildings.

+  sky borders in outdoor rooms

-  ARCH_W_WINDOW


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

-  pictures in walls

-  diagonal corners

-  secret niches

-  cages (in the void chunks)

-  normal doors

?  system for texture coordinates:

     u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

     x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
     y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)

?  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

?  better exits
