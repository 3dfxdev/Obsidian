WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Caves:

!!! get SPOTS working again

+  floor sinks:
   -  occasionally have SINK1 as liquid, SINK2 == AREA
      [ and SINK1 floor_dz = -24 ]

   -  occasionally have SINK2 = SINK1 (when no liquid)

   -  rarely have SINK1 = AREA, SINK2 is what SINK1 would have been

+  review all cave themes [ some are FUGLY! ]
   also want more variety, e.g. ROCKRED in Urban/Tech theme

-  think about WHEN it make sense for cave to "see" the walls of
   a room (like outdoor rooms do)



Miscellaneous:

-  cage railings : add them later (after finish_scenic_borders)
                   since we have no height info until then.

+  joiner facades STILL borked
   [ perhaps they can have TWO facades ?? ]

+  generally improve facade assignment



Tidying Up / Release stuff:

-  check for !!! in code

-  check for prob=30*99 in rules and prefabs

-  update i18n language template

-  test: Doom 1
-  test: Ultimate Doom
-  test: TNT and Egypt theme
-  test: Plutonia

-  test the addon-package system
