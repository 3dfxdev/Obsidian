WORK IN PROGRESS
================


---->  light value for entities in prefabs


!!! segment hallways into smaller sections
    (especially where they join the rooms)

    do it _before_ Areas_handle_connections.


!!!!  get locked doors working again


>>>  create wall and corner information for each room


!!!  get closets working again

!!  get big junctions working again

!!  get cycles working again


>>  get 'height' value into 'env' pick_skin() tables


!!  fix street mode

!!  street mode : if one room surrounds another one, the "streets"
    between them are isolated from the rest, leading to this error:

      Script Error: Failed to find any height in grid neighbors

    --> detect this, make multiple "street" rooms
