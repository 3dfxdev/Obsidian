===========

Current Work
------------

>>>  light_globe and flame entities for QUAKE

>>>  big junction test: FIX HOLES


Fence stuff

-  review


Outdoor Borders:

-  properly pick the facade for fake buildings



Hallways:

+  issue: no locked doors between two hallways
          (guess it ain't happening now since we merge 99% of the time)
 
!!  no adjusters (need lifty prefabs / skins)

+  ability to have stairs / lifts

>>>  big junction prefabs!

  DONE: need to select I/C/T/P versions of a skin
        (using same mechanism as for normal hallway pieces)

     -  need _either_ I/C/T/P versions of each prefab
             _or_     a mechanism to use a single prefab (CONDITIONAL STUFF)
                      [can be done using height variables]

Idea: GAME.HALLWAY_GROUPS

      basic =
      {
        Hall_basic_I = 50
        Hall_basic_V = 50
        Hall_basic_S = 50

        Hall_basic_C = 50
        Hall_basic_T = 50
        Hall_basic_P = 50

        Junc_basic_I = 50
        Junc_basic_C = 50
        Junc_basic_T = 50
        Junc_basic_P = 50
      }

      IN LEVEL THEME:

      hall_groups = { basic=50, curvilicious=50 }


WISH: outdoor hallways (wall on one side, fence on other side, sky top)
      [may be easier to convert hallway into a room]
      hard part: ensuring such a hallway stays above nearby room(s)
      hmmm, could also work bordering an _indoor_ room (no sky)


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Next WIP Goals
==============

+  hallway stuff sorted out

+  theme stuff sorted out


+  proper building facades

   -  create "scenic" chunks in unused seeds as part of a building 

   -  narrowify floor and ceiling parts next to a wall

+  windows and fences

   -  must decide after all heights are done

   -  need to harmonize sky heights

+  sky borders in outdoor rooms

-  ARCH_W_WINDOW



+  automatic repeating of prefabs
   x_repeat=192 : means we require: x_size / N >= x_repeat (for highest N)

   allow it to happen with prefab composition too

-  outdoor wall extender: 64x64 block with torch on top

+  flat mismatch where hallways meet rooms
   (a) have a step (ideally not flush with wall)
   (b) put a door there
   (c) use floor texture in hallway (only works at one end)

Theme System:

-  proper room themes for QUAKE

-  QUAKE II


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

-  pictures in walls

-  diagonal corners

-  secret niches

-  cages (in the void chunks)

-  normal doors

?  system for texture coordinates:

     u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

     x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
     y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)

?  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

?  better exits
