THEME SYSTEM
============

Every level has a single 'Level Theme', defined in GAME.LEVEL_THEMES.
This is game-specific, so in the Lua file it appears with the game
namespace before it, like: QUAKE.LEVEL_THEMES.

Levels are divided (generally by keyed doors) into 'Zones' which
have their own 'Zone Theme', defined in GAME.ZONE_THEMES.

Zones consist of rooms and each room has it's own 'Room Theme',
defined in GAME.ROOM_THEMES.  That includes hallways too.

The GAME.THEME_DEFAULTS table provides info which can be common to
every theme -- and hence that stuff does not need to be repeated in
all the specific themes.

The most specific theme overrides any values from the less specific
one, with the following priorities:

   ROOM_THEMES > ZONE_THEMES > LEVEL_THEMES > THEME_DEFAULTS

Zone Themes can be absent, in which case OBLIGE will create its own
one using the data in the Level Theme.

Room Themes could theoretically be absent, but generally aren't since
the textures used for buildings tend to look bad for caves (and vice
versa).
