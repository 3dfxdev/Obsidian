OBLIGE TODO
===========

Current Work
------------

!!!!  fix the "no spot for wotsit" error

+  have a monster exclusion zone around teleporters

-  street_mode and hub_mode : don't use styles for them


!!!  the "apply twice" problem in prefab build code

-  support m="bounds" brushes (e.g. for QUAKE2_TELEPORTER)


Hallways:
  !!  monsters / items in hallways
      --> set 'belong_room' of hallway, add hall mons to that battle

  !!  fix chunk alignment in hallway connections

	+  proper height setting, use lifts when necessary


Cross-Overs:
  !!  heights are messed up?

  !!  problem where rooms get surrounded by a crossover and then
      cannot connect to anything else.

      possible solutions:
 >>   (1) require over room to already be connected to another room
      (2) teleporters
      (3) require hall to only touch two section sides (never more)
          and allow connection to non-self crossover halls
      (4) detect the problem and convert cross-over to two normal conns
          [or detect and turn crossed room into a scenic lava pit]
>>>>  (5) only make them from JUNC --> JUNC (through a reclaimed HORIZ or VERT)
          and allow (in worst case) room to join that hall.
          ALSO: support crossing 3 sections [if seeds <= 5]
          ALSO 2: corner crossing (90 degree turn)
                  can "allocate" the JUNC and create two crossover chunks

  WISH: ability to cross-over same room twice in single hall
        [even from a single junction]

  +  build the bridges / channels using prefabs

  -  fix hallway vertical gaps


-----------------------------------------------------------------


WISH: 3D bridges can be 3D stairs [relax area touching rule]



FIX: areas may be separated by "scenic" chunks
     --> prevent that, c.f. sub-room logic in V3


Windows: MUST decide them after all heights are done



5. corner prefab -- chunk is assumed not to be passable anymore,
   can make the whole thing solid [c.f. the V3 corner seeds]
   or make a curve or diagonal -- anything a prefab can do.
   
   need to make sure that room stays traversible

6. wall prefab -- touches one (and only one) edge of room,
   could make whole thing solid, or whatever a prefab can do.

7. big middle prefab, e.g. nukage pit



>>>  Simple rooms (caves and mazes)



OTHER STUFF

!!  u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

    x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
    y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Goals for next WIP
==================

+  crossovers

+  proper building facades

+  windows and fences

-  sky borders in outdoor rooms

+  system for texture coordinates


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

+  working pictures

+  caves working again

+  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

+  liquid areas


-  normal doors

-  cages

-  secret niches


?  better exits

?  diagonal corners

?  void seeds
