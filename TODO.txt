OBLIGE TODO
===========

Current Work
------------


-  occasionally void up the JUNCTIONS in an indoor room


!!  windows and fences DO NOT straddle, and outdoor rooms DO NOT
    build the outdoor facade of buildings.


>>>  lift prefabs for high adjusters


HALLWAYS: don't auto-merge chunks


++  models in .MAP exporter


-  position-based monster ordering 



Hallways:
  !!  fix chunk alignment in hallway connections

  !!  monsters / items in hallways
      --> set 'belong_room' of hallway, add hall mons to that battle

  +  proper height setting, use lifts when necessary


-----------------------------------------------------------------


FIX: areas may be separated by "scenic" chunks
     --> prevent that, c.f. sub-room logic in V3


Windows: MUST decide them after all heights are done



5. corner prefab -- chunk is assumed not to be passable anymore,
   can make the whole thing solid [c.f. the V3 corner seeds]
   or make a curve or diagonal -- anything a prefab can do.
   
   need to make sure that room stays traversible

6. wall prefab -- touches one (and only one) edge of room,
   could make whole thing solid, or whatever a prefab can do.

7. big middle prefab, e.g. nukage pit



-----------------------------------------------------------------


Goals for next WIP
==================

+  crossovers

+  proper building facades

+  windows and fences

+  liquid areas

-  sky borders in outdoor rooms


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

+  system for texture coordinates:

     u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

     x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
     y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)

+  working pictures

+  caves working again

+  better ceilings, some ceiling lights


-  normal doors

-  cages

-  secret niches


?  better exits

?  diagonal corners

?  void seeds
