TODO
====

*  get more games working (Heretic, Hexen etc)

*  support for Traps, Cages, Secrets, Powerups

*  add in more scenery: lamps, computers etc


Natural areas:

  DONE:  CAVE: more cave wall @ building borders

  PRELIM  place monsters in walkable spots
  PRELIM  place items in walkable spots
  PRELIM  place purpose (key / switch) in open spot

  -  height changes 

  DONE:  create jaggy edges

  DONE:  small chance an island region becomes a lava pit

  -  choose between CAVE / LANDSCAPE / LAKE mode  -- via STYLES[]

  -  decide #ROOMS based on theme (e.g. less in TECH)

  PRELIM  proper theming (c.f. THEME.building)

  DONE:  "layering" : perform multiple 'grow + render' passes

  -  create two "combos" for caves on each map (sim. landscapes)

  -  trimming: try to avoid same material as previous one
  
  -  better bordering with outdoor areas

  -  layering: if last is "deep liquid", it bugs mon/pickup spots
     (find the spots later ??)

  -  windows facing landscapes : can it be done??


-  single (or two?) border seeds around map
   (plus space for monster depots)
 

dm_level.cc  >>>  fix up extrafloor stuff



>>>  don't use tech_outdoor exit in HELL themes

>>>  rework liquids

++  BUG: sky height out-of-sync, causing bars to become one-sided
    (cf MAP04 of chris's map).

?  need to explain (Usage Guide, README) that some modules must
   be run with additional wads or packages, in particular the
   ZDoom Beastiary module.


+  support MAPINFO lumps (especially for ZDoom ports).

-  stairs: messed up in some themes??

+  review monster quantities, need some increase over the course
   of a level (like 50% more monsters at end compared to start)
   and maybe better pacing (e.g. nothing in a room occasionally).

   Also may need to create smaller room palettes for small
   quantities (i.e. Less or Scarce settings).

-  review big room logic


+  more supplies in start room (ammo for weapon, armor vest)

+  Quests : add locks (new arenas) even when have no keys

-  rarity for bfg10k and railgun for Skulltag

-  allow export to .map files


-  implement more of Chris's and Johnny's boss maps

-  rework Build_small_exit to only use a single transform,

-  BUG: lowering item pedestals can go into ceiling

-  BUG: items occasionally appear on skyfences
   - finding small spots ignores sideway extents (thick[])

-  BUG: outdoor bars can sometimes be jumped over.
   --> make them higher _or_ another switch to lower them.



CSG CODE:

!!!! DOOM: build sidedefs/linedefs in memory !!!!

!!  proper quantization, remove degenerate segments / brushes 

!!  do a proper face-creation pass (merge_face_c list
    in each merge_segment_c ?) and get proper brush
    and area_vert references.

    Hence remove the CSG2_FindXXX rubbish.

!!  DOOM: fix y_offset values

+   DOOM: merge linedefs where possible


Quakey:
+  merge Q#_CreateEntities into a common function

q1_nodes:
  -  floor_leaf --> leaf
  ?? move floor/ceiling faces into leaf.faces (instead of leaf.floor)
