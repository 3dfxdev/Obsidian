WORK IN PROGRESS
================


+  SHAPE GRAMMARS:

   +  detect if a rule is horizontally symmetrical (preprocess phase)

   -  detect if a rule is diagonally symmetrical (going North-East)

   -  support "w=2" in a symmetry table : then the axis of symmetry is
      actually the middle line of a pair of seeds

   -  write mapping function(s) for a symmetry table
      -  straight w=1 case
      -  straight w=2 case
      -  diagonal case


   +  support mirroring along an axis (possibly diagonal)


   -  fix gx1..gy2 to be a useful range to try rules
      [ Hmmm basically it is current extent of room, i.e. sx1..sy2, so
        probably just use sx1..sy2 ??? ]


>>>   create edges for connections  [ HOW ??? ]

   -  be more semantically aware, e.g. pick areas where to make
      staircases / liquid areas / closets

   +  prune / re-use rooms which remain small, and hallways which
      never end up anywhere else


-  titlepic backgrounds (current and new) :
   determine ones for official package, put rest in an addon


+  face direction for switches


!!  some trap doors do not open
    [ door next-to door thing.... ]
