===========

(Note: Oblige no longer supports Wolf3d)


Wolf3D:

   + push-walls for secret quests!
   + secret elevators
   + bosses!

   - decide_monster : skills are "tiered"
   - health/ammo : no skills! -- use medium one
   - place_items : never where monsters are!
   - create rooms with 'endgame' object.

   (later) ensure limits are enforced:
     - MAXACTORS = 150  (remove actors at random)
     - MAXSTATS  = 400  (remove statics at random)
     - MAXDOORS  = 64   (remove unneeded doors at random)

   (later) patrolling monsters (need to create path with arrows).
   (later) secret levels (full of treasure)
   (later) something interesting in middle of big rooms.
   (later) elevator "entry" in first room.
   (later) widen some arches.
