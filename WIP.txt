WORK IN PROGRESS
================


>>  support a "nothing" entity


-  wall-detail ideas
   (a) Runes  (w/ fireblue? scrolling snskin?)
   (b) square-wave



Level Size:

+  levels sometimes too small -- do extra sprout passes (WHEN?)

+  smaller rooms (when "is_big" is not set)



Door Logic:

+  check how prefabs are marked as "lifts" and "doors"
   [ using "kind" is insufficent for joiners ]

   ??  is_lift / is_door fields


-  REVIEW : "rarity" for themes  [ remove it and KISS ?? ]


+  F/R cages: also want mid-bars and/or corner posts [ esp. cages surrounded by liquids ]

-  sometimes have flashing/oscillate FX for free-range cages

-  more pillars in rooms

-  IDEA: build "landscape" rooms as a hallway network, but after
         sprout phase convert seeds to "landscape" and _then_
         expand outwards to hit buildings / edge of map.


-  IDEA: aversion for rules, decreases prob of using rule again in a room

-  IDEA: level_usage, room_usage
   [ OR: level_skip,  room_skip ]
