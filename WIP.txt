WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Miscellaneous
-------------

+  crates/cages/pillars right in front of teleporter/start/exit closets

-  have a closet for start rooms, prefer it for "START" goal

-  implement "P" shape closets  [ all four sides == area ]

-  railing brushes : require a bottom face

-  get posts working with rail junctions again

-  internal fences (esp. for outdoor rooms)

-  strong tendency to lock the exit room

-  a less ornate secret item closet, small items (e.g. 10 potions)



Hallway System
--------------

+  make hallway themes for deuce (tech/urban/hell), and
   review the existing xxx_Hallway themes.

   e.g. BLOOD1 for ceiling/floor in hell
   e.g. SKSPINE2 for wall in hell

+  make some deuce stairs

-  fix issue with T-shape stairs



Parks
-----

+  height variation  [ different areas ]

-  ensure the heighest FLOOR contributes to zone.sky_h

-  use TWO floor textures



Scenic Borders
--------------

-  need posts where two different floor heights meet (for railing)

-  handle stairs adjacent to a border : need a brush for the
   side and a post where that brush meets the low floor



Web Site
--------

-  update usage doc on THEME setting, e.g.:

   the "Jumbled" theme setting means each map's theme is chosen purely
   randomly (like a dice throw), where "bit mixed" means groups of maps (2-4)
   have the same theme before choosing a new (random) one.  The "xxx-ish"
   settings means you get mostly "xxx" but with an occasionally different one
   thrown in.

-  add "Symmetry" to glossary, e.g.:

   Symmetry is where rooms are mirrored, e.g. has the same architecture on
   the left side as the right side.
