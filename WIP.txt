WORK IN PROGRESS
================

BUG: place_item_list loves to crap out around generating 5-6th map,
     when skulltag monsters/items are enabled.  -- pancirno

BUG: outdoor border placed next to an outdoor lake -- no wall is
     placed between them, can give a gap for the player to walk.


+  monster angles!
   -  small chance of ALL no change (same as prefabs)
   -  small chance of ALL completely random
   -  if use ambush spot, usually look towards that spot
   -  not ambush: often look at entry coord
   -  sometimes look at an important item  [small chance: ALL]
   -  otherwise random

+  use ambush spots : 90% DEAF (50% if float)
   -  50% of monsters want ambush spot [occas: 95%]

-  if not ambush spot, 20% DEAF

-  quantity (etc?) in hallways -- check prefabs

-  sometimes : place baddest monsters at furthest spots from entry
   [when iterating through palette, do toughest mons first, and
    find_cost = 1000 / dist_to_entry_coord]

-  pick a "guard" monster for certain rooms, place it
   (really the BOSS for an exit or near-exit room)
   skip that monster when deciding palette [usually :]

?  reintroduce some "toughness" system

-  when pick non-near spot : prefer different section than last one

-  in dark rooms, invis monsters higher prob, treat as non-replacing

DONE:  melee monsters : pick spots away from centre of prefab
