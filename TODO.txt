Next WIP Goals
--------------

(3) 3D patterns in Quake:

    (a) have 'z1_cap' and 'z2_cap' fields in a chunk, ensure all
        prefabs use it -- perhaps: Trans.set_cap(), Trans.clear_cap()

        Problem: chunks may partially overlap!

(5) Get QUAKE working well
    DONE: some tech pictures
    DONE: some castley pictures
    - hack to get pictures aligned correctly (e.g. "hack_picture" keyword)


-----------------------------------------------------------------


+  x_repeat should be a skin thang


+  have "hallway arches", specified in hallway groups, used in
   indoor rooms where the hallway meets the room.


>>>  big_junction hallways : use 'mini_halls' instead of a hallway group

     also: some control over them
     (a) disable (or prefer) certain height diffs
     (b) disable doors (since big junction has a door there)
         [extends to doors at room/mini_hall connection]
     (c) can provide a skin with 'floor', 'wall' and/or 'ceil' materials
     (d) can specify other keywords which must be preset or absent in the skin


>>>  stairs / lift : standardize height stuff

     _elevation = "short" / "medium" / "tall" / "lift"

     z_ranges = { {128,0,"?height"}, ... }  in prefab to make it reach target height


++  think about how "mini halls" and "groups" interact

    --> groups only apply to connected hallways (2+ sections)
    
    --> mini_halls connect two rooms, or a room and big junction

    i.e. they are mutually exclusive


+  mini hall room connection control:
      _outdoor = 0 / 1
      _building = 0 / 1
      _cave = 0 / 1

+  support height-changing mini-halls


3D Areas:

PATTERN LOGIC : skip patterns if (a) multiple levels,
                                 (b) 2+ chunks in that grid and all of them would
                                     end up in the same vhr
                              OR (b2) one chunk in grid but ends up at same vhr
                                      as all previously assigned chunks in room


+  fix monsters stuck in doors / corners of chunks

+  fix fat doors (x_ranges) : QUAKE


-----------------------------------------------------------------


>>  windows

>>  pictures in walls

>>  secret niches

-  normal doors  [c.f. mini-hall doors]

-  ceiling prefabs (esp. light fixtures)

-  floor prefabs (crates are great, cages are all the rage)

>>  better exits

-  liquid areas

Closets:
+  allow closet to be smaller than chunk, fill extra space with void
