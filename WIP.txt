WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Parks
-----

+  merge blobs that sit on a diagonal with the one at the
   opposite corner -- to prevent the narrow gap which can
   sometimes be too narrow to fit through

+  prevent a tree ON or TOUCHING a diagonal

+  decide height jumps (for profile)
   - often 16
   - often 32
   - less often 48
   - rare-ish 64

+  liquid pools
   -  hazard_health
   -  radiation suit (one per room, perhaps close to mid-point)

-  once a hill division is decided, then iterate several
   height variations and pick the "best".
   [ e.g. prefer highest floor has GOAL or a connection ]
   [ also want good "separation" of walk chunks between floors ]
   [[ ALSO: prefer no "cliffs" near conns, esp. entry conn ]]

-  ability to make a floor (or TWO) into a liquid
   [ require no connections, except free-standing teleporters ]
   [[ other floors MUST be higher ]]

-  windows and cages can be too low
   [ logic for AREA:min_neighbor_h and max_... needs to look
     into "nature" areas properly ]

IDEA: do A* pathing through room, mark blobs as "must_walk"



Miscellaneous
-------------

+  railings : max_z (or so) value, support in CSG DOOM

-  internal fences (esp. for outdoor rooms)

-  no UAC crates in Hell please

-  lack of barrels

-  make "Jumbled" theme try to avoid being same as last one



Hallway System
--------------

+  make hallway themes for deuce (tech/urban/hell), and
   review the existing xxx_Hallway themes.

   e.g. BLOOD1 for ceiling/floor in hell
   e.g. SKSPINE2 for wall in hell

+  make some deuce stairs

-  fix issue with T-shape stairs



Scenic Borders
--------------

-  need posts where two different floor heights meet (for railing)

-  handle stairs adjacent to a border : need a brush for the
   side and a post where that brush meets the low floor



Web Site
--------

-  update usage doc on THEME setting, e.g.:

   the "Jumbled" theme setting means each map's theme is chosen purely
   randomly (like a dice throw), where "bit mixed" means groups of maps (2-4)
   have the same theme before choosing a new (random) one.  The "xxx-ish"
   settings means you get mostly "xxx" but with an occasionally different one
   thrown in.

-  add "Symmetry" to glossary, e.g.:

   Symmetry is where rooms are mirrored, e.g. has the same architecture on
   the left side as the right side.
