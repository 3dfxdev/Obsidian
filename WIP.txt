WORK IN PROGRESS
================


SINKS:

+  set ceiling of stairs to highest nearby ceil group
   !!  test stair prefab for "plain_ceiling" flag

-  for SKY holes, require group.h > max_floor + 130

-  fix interaction with importants / decorations / fs-cages :

   -  ceiling sinks always inhibit ceiling decoration

   -  floor sinks *can* inhibit floor-decorations :

   -  check inner point of middle of 2x2 chunk (more if bigger)
      and if it is "floor_inner" then *can* allow a decoration
      [ depending on, um, ..... def.no_sink ]

   -  for importants (like KEYS), make *them* inhibit sinks
