WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Caves:

!!! get SPOTS working again

>>>  get walkway working again
   +  honor the liquid and sky modes

   -  sometimes have no WALK2  (then WALK1 is liquid)
   -  occasionally have WALK2 is indent
   -  sometimes WALK1+WALK2 both sky, or just WALK2
   -  occasionally have WALK1 as liquid, WALK2 floor same as AREA

-  for adjust_corner, generate a string for each cell

      e.g. "S-FFFFF-CCCCC-LLL"

-  review torches, e.g. occasionally use candelabra in Hell,
   and lamps in Tech

-  review all cave themes [ some are FUGLY! ]
   also want more variety

-  investigate using RoundCorners on cave sectors
   to improve torch lighting



Miscellaneous:

+  outdoor decor : when prefab is picked, we DONT KNOW real sky height
   [ see if can pick prefab later on... ]

+  entities from wall prefabs NOT removed from spots??
   -->  have a "solid_entities = true" in def, apply it... somewhere

+  outdoor borders : check more seeds
