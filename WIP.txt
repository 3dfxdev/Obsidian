-  fix texturing on some stairs and diagonals

-  Chris's icon maps



Later
=====

+  intrusions: like "junking" a side, but connects two other rooms
   (they are really just a hallway, but merging itself with the
    neighboring room as much as possible)

+  sky-halls (variation of the above, no?)

+  closets (as in V4 / V5)

+  get stairwells working again, have outdoor version w/ rails

+  apply nice items gotten in normal rooms to the HMODEL


-  ability to centre doors (on two seeds)

-  in 2x2 rooms, place key/switch in middle of room
   [ monster/item spots are the hard part ]

-  outdoor fences should straddle both rooms
   (but need to handle corners and T junctions)

-  wider arches: be good to make them TALLER too

-  ensure normal doors are usually monster-openable, secret doors not
