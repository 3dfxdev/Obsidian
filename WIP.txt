WORK IN PROGRESS
================


SINKS:

+  set ceiling of stairs to highest nearby ceil group
   -  BUT test stair prefab for "plain_ceiling" flag

-  support sink.light and sink.trim_light

-  fix interaction with importants / decorations / fs-cages :

   -  ceiling sinks always inhibit ceiling decoration

   -  floor sinks *can* inhibit floor-decorations :

   -  check inner point of middle of 2x2 chunk (more if bigger)
      and if it is "floor_inner" then *can* allow a decoration
      [ depending on, um, ..... def.no_sink ]

   -  for importants (like KEYS), make *them* inhibit sinks



NEW LIGHTING:

DONE:  pick base lighting of each room

+  decide if each area will be BASE + 0, BASE + 16, or BASE + 32
   and that decides what kinds of light prefabs to add
   [ i.e. ceiling light fittings or "big" light decorations ]

-  sink-based lights / sky should force/require the brightest area in room

-  ignore area light for wall stuff

+  some ceiling light fixtures

??  for joiners and doors/windows : pick a value roughly between
    the two sides.  E.g. if diff == 32, use lowest + 16
    When diff == 16, use the darkest side.
    Remember to take shadow side into account for straddlers.



MISC:

-  see what looks bad in DOOM 1 ;)
