MODDING GUIDE
The core of OBLIGE is written in the LUA scripting language, and those
files are located in the "obl_data" folder with names like
"planner.lua" and "th_doom1.lua". Because they are simply text files,
you can edit them with a text editor (Notepad) and, assuming nothing
got borked up, the changes will be used the next time you run OBLIGE --
no need to compile anything.
