WORK IN PROGRESS
================


+  Caves!

+  wall pictures

+  better spot_for_wotsit  (see V5 code)

+  higher fences near a key / item / switch


+  rare stuck monsters (e.g. Mastermind on an exit switch)

+  item placement too close to wall

-  misaligned uppers (due to lighting and/or crates)

-  fix texturing on some stairs and diagonals

-  ability to centre doors (on two seeds)


+  Unix makefile / installation

-  Debian package

-  Changelog

-  rework History page for website


Later
=====

+  intrusions: like "junking" a side, but connects two other rooms

+  closets (as in V4 / V5)

+  sky-halls

-  in 2x2 rooms, place key/switch in middle of room
   [ monster/item spots are the hard part ]

-  outdoor fences should straddle both rooms
   (but need to handle corners and T junctions)

-  wider arches: be good to make them TALLER too

-  ensure normal doors are usually monster-openable, secret doors not
