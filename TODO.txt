>> PLAY-TEST: Health/Ammo adjustments

-  add some TNT/Plutonia stuff.

+  more exit themes!
   -  different switch/hole methods
   -  able to make smaller rooms (void_it_up), esp. with wall switch
   -  put exit "bumps" on floor outside
   -  teleport method

-  sky_lights: decide sky based on "ceiling thickness"
-  replace 'c.floor_h' and 'K.ceil_h' with the 'rmodel' field.
-  floor heights: for Heretic/Hexen, limit slope to prevent lifts
-  fix cage railing when cage borders a higher chunk or Fence
   (raise fence to cage top and omit railing texture but keep IMPASS).
-  don't put a railing _between_ cages
-  idea: "scenic_wall" / "scenic_void" for middle of 3x3 chunk


GUI TODO
--------

-  test if output file (if not exists) can be written to.

-  handle the Abort button better, also glbsp-failure.

-  different adjustments for DM levels.

??  separate 'obl_scr' and 'obl_dat' directories.

MILESTONE 0  (reached!)
===========

Able to create a map of connected areas, with a
few items / monsters, and which works in DOOM.


MILESTONE 1  (reached!)
===========

a) Planning:

   #  proper quest structure, E branches off a cell
      between S and K.

   #  quests: KEY, SWITCH, WEAPON

b) Builder:
 
   #  create a reasonable room in each cell,

   #  create doors between rooms, KEYED when required

   #  add exit switch to final room

   #  player model: (health, armour, ammo, weapons)

   #  add some monsters
 
   #  add some supplies (health, ammo)

c) Writer:

   #  support fragments

   #  texture X alignment (esp. fragments)


MILESTONE 2  (reached!)
===========

#  working GUI interface using FLTK

#  build WAD files directly (no wadlc step).

#  use GLBSP plugin to build nodes automatically.

#  more architecture features:

   #  pillars
   #  lights / sky-holes in the ceiling
   #  paintings / computers / lights in the wall
   #  monster cages
   #  monster closets (esp. along a back-track route)
   #  monsters teleporting in


MILESTONE 3  (heaps left to do!!)
===========

#  heights: (a) each quest, target height (at end)
            (b) approach modes: sharp vs gradual change, bumpy

+  allocation system for blocks (can_walk tests).

?? larger rooms (2-8 chunks in each dimension).

+  teleporters!

+  secrets

-  bridge switches

-  liquid pools and traps

+  good support for the different games (Doom 1/2, Heretic, Hexen),
   and initial support for add-ons (Eternal, Osiris)

+  pillar patterns: 1379, 2468, line thru center (based on entry and exit)
-  chunk-size cages: center of room
-  chunk-size cages: outdoor and top-less

+  floor switches: y_offset
-  wall switches: place in the wall! 
-  wall switches: "small" mode (32x32)

-  overhangs: thick and central pillars
   ++ BUG: don't create pillar in front of door

-  more mid-masked textures (esp. on windows)
-  prefer not to create void chunks next to windows
-  doors: underneath flat should match front texture.
-  compute_line_flags: more explicit flags (esp. override)

-  closets: 
   (a) fix way closet is put in chunk (remove side field)

+  overall consistency (doors/lights/overhangs/windows)
