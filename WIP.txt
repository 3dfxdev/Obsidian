WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Runes : tidy up, make a SNKSKIN or BFALL or ROCKRED variation 


IDEA : a sharp corner removal pass [ before border stuff ]
       ] preserve symmetry, e.g. by preferring horizontal direction to merge ]


!!  apply_num  for different passes [ especially DECORATE ]


Caves:

!!  actually make them again



Doors and Joiners:

+  I shape joiners can have "deep" and "over" values,
   allow them to overlap nearby room as per doors

   [ update all joiner prefabs with 16 unit deep and over ]

-  support "deep" and "over" for L-shape joiners

+  env field for doors and joiners are two values separated by a
   slash, e.g. "building/outdoor".  first value is front side,
   second value is back side.

   - if env field is a single keyword, equivalent to doubling it
     e.g. "cave" ---> "cave/cave"

   - support the word "any", e.g. "outdoor/any"
     [ so default value is "any/any" ]

   - support negation, e.g. "cave/!cave"

   - "indoor" is equivalent to "!outdoor"

-  fix level control "Doors" setting for joiners



Miscellaneous:

+  prevent decor in liquid sinks  [ EXCEPT liquid_pipe...  "liquid_decor" kind ]

+  F/R cages: also want mid-bars and/or corner posts [ esp. cages surrounded by liquids ]

-  sometimes have flashing/oscillate FX for free-range cages

-  more pillars in rooms
