OBLIGE TODO
===========

Current Work
------------

>>>  fake buildings : ensure only built ONCE at a seed

!!  fix the sky fences in places where they don't belong
    
    also : can be unused gap between two outdoor rooms, 
           but only one room "grabs" the gap for a sky border

-  automatic "sky" brushes (if no 'm' coord and b/t material is "_SKY")


Theme System:

-  proper room themes for QUAKE

-  HERETIC

-  QUAKE II


Hallways:
  -  decide walls properly (i.e. no hall_path[dir])

  -  make some chunk-size prefabs and use them

  !!  determine ceiling heights properly


Caves:
  !!!!  spots for monsters and items

  -  proper floor and ceiling textures

  -  better floors, liquid areas

  -  better ceilings, chance of sky

  -  create a large area (or two) by merging areas together
     [OR: pre-allocate a large chunk / reclaimed junction]



-----------------------------------------------------------------


Next WIP Goals
==============

+  hallway stuff sorted out

+  cave stuff sorted out

+  theme stuff sorted out


+  proper building facades

   -  create "scenic" chunks in unused seeds as part of a building 

   -  narrowify floor and ceiling parts next to a wall

+  windows and fences

   -  must decide after all heights are done

   -  need to harmonize sky heights

   -  windows and fences DO NOT straddle, and outdoor rooms ARE NOT
      responsible for the outdoor facade of buildings.

+  sky borders in outdoor rooms

-  ARCH_W_WINDOW


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

-  pictures in walls

-  diagonal corners

-  secret niches

-  cages (in the void chunks)

-  normal doors

?  system for texture coordinates:

     u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

     x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
     y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)

?  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

?  better exits
