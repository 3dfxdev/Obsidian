<h2>OBLIGE : Recent Development</h2>

by Andrew Apted. &nbsp; 22nd November 2008

<p>
Progress on OBLIGE has been slow,
some might say [i]glacial[/i],
since the last update,
but things are still happening.

<p>
There was several attempts at creating better
whole-level designs for maps.  The first one was
called a "Zone" system, big square areas that would
be populated with rooms, or sub-divided into smaller
zones.  Seemed promising but it didn't work out.
Next I tried a "Room Fab" system, which connected
pre-fabricated room shapes together to make a
whole map.  It was great at making room/hallway
mazes, but lousy when it came to outdoor areas.
The final system is called the "Land Map", it
involves making a crude representation which
consists of building, ground or liquid areas.
This one is working very nicely.

<p>
The GUI has changed again, especially the area for
Custom Modules.  Getting the custom modules to work
properly (including module-specific options) and
getting CONFIG.CFG loading/saving again all took a
long time, but is working fine now.

<p>
The Quest system, which is responsible for deciding
where to put locked doors and what keys/switches to
use for them, needed to be rewritten.  The old way
decided all the quests first, and creating rooms to
fulfil those quests.  That didn't work with the Land-Map
system, hence the new way firstly connects all the rooms
(including outdoor areas), then decides how to split the
level into smaller quests and where the locked doors
should go.  It's actually harder than it sounds.
