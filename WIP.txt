WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Miscellaneous
-------------

-  "aversion" for rules, decreases prob of using rule again in a room

+  lighting in caves mucked up?  [ check Ambient_push/pop ]

-  texture on monster-in teleport spots


-  sprouts from symmetrical rooms : often skip a side

+  need the switch-door quests [ for large/extreme levels ]

-  internal fences (esp. for outdoor rooms)

-  Traps prefabs have an "action_kind", use matching action
   for the trigger lines.   [ "open" vs "lower" ]
   Q/ how to pick the matching action
   A/ decide it for the trapped thing early, require trap prefabs tp
      have a matching value



Hallway System
--------------

+  make hallway themes for deuce (tech/urban/hell), and
   review the existing xxx_Hallway themes.

   e.g. BLOOD1 for ceiling/floor in hell
   e.g. SKSPINE2 for wall in hell

+  make some deuce stairs


-  support over-sized pieces (e.g. 3x1 and 3x3 for vent)
   [ will need all I/L/T/P shapes ]
   [[ good for traps! ]]

?  support pieces with windows
   [ the window side needs _OUTER tex and ability to make it flush ]

?  be real nice to have pieces which are wall on one
   side and open on the other (with sky ceiling OR like nearby ceiling)
   [ BUT: will need to expand vertically ]

   also: open on ALL sides  (mainly I and L pieces)

?  complex shapes: shape = { "mid", "-", "mid", "-" }

   keywords can be: "-"     (no connections)
                    "mid"   (middle of side)
                    "left"
                    "right"
                    "split" (one on left, one on right)
                    "window"
                    "open"

       function REMAP(pos)
          if pos == "left"  then return "right" end
          if pos == "right" then return "left" end
          return pos
       end

       function mirror_X_complex_shape(SH)
          SH[4], SH[6] = REMAP(SH[6]), REMAP(SH[4])
          SH[2], SH[8] = REMAP(SH[2]), REMAP(SH[8])
       end

       function mirror_Y_complex_shape(SH)
          SH[2], SH[8] = REMAP(SH[8]), REMAP(SH[2])
          SH[4], SH[6] = REMAP(SH[4]), REMAP(SH[6])
       end

       function transpose_complex_shape(SH)
          SH[2], SH[4] = REMAP(SH[4]), REMAP(SH[2])
          SH[8], SH[6] = REMAP(SH[6]), REMAP(SH[8])
       end



Scenic Borders
--------------

-  need posts where two different floor heights meet (for railing)

-  handle stairs adjacent to a border : need a brush for the
   side and a post where that brush meets the low floor

+  different styles:
   - mountainy areas  (w/ trees or torches)
   - cavey/liquidy areas
   - fenced off pools from V7-WEIRD
   - fancy fences

-  block travel 2/3 seeds into simple fence (archvile jumps etc)
   [ esp. where a simple fence is joined to a watery_drop ]



PARKS
-----

+  height variation  [ different areas ]

-  inhibit items in bits of floor cut-off by river
   [ create another FLOOR for them BUT not stored in info.floors list ]

+  sky handling:
   -  ensure the heighest FLOOR contributes to zone.sky_h

-  consider texturing

-  review outdoor ROOM_THEMEs, remove/replace any "floors" which
   are actually natural-ish

-  add a style for it, decide room properly



Quake3 CSG Code
---------------

-  brushlib function to visit side faces, and if they
   contain u1/u2/v1/v2 then compute the uv_mat

-  brushlib function to visit top/bottom faces, and generate
   a uv_mat if the sides contain tu/tv/bu/bv values
