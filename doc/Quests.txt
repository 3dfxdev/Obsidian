Quests Structure
================

A "quest" is a series of connected rooms where the final
room contains the goal of the quest, such as a key or
weapon.

There are two basic types: "lock" quests and "mini" quests.
Lock quests form the main structure of the level, containing
all the things you _must_ do (e.g. when playing the level
without any monsters).  Examples include: getting a key,
pressing a switch (to open a door or lower bars), or even
killing a boss monster which causes a pathway to open up
(such as the Bruiser Brothers in E1M8 of DOOM).

Mini quests are for weapons, powerups or could even be
just a room full of health and ammo.  Secrets are always
mini quests because you should never need to find a secret
to finish a level.  Mini quests always "extend" an existing
quest, basically making the parent quest larger and giving
a sub-goal.

The very last quest is called an "end" quest (though
technically it has the same status as a lock quest).
End quests usually lead to a room with an exit switch
or an exit elevator (for Wolf3d).


Example
-------

The essential structure of a level might be:

     start
       |
       V
  1. lock quest (red key)
  2. lock quest (press blue switch)
  3. lock quest (yellow key)
  4. end quest


Then add in some mini quests:

  1. lock quest (red key)
     1.1 mini quest (super shotgun)
     1.2 mini quest (rocket launcher)
     1.3 mini quest (chainsaw)

  2. lock quest (press blue switch)
     2.1 mini quest (invisibility sphere)

  3. lock quest (yellow key)
     3.1 mini quest (backpack full of ammo)
     3.2 mini quest (plasma rifle)

  4. end quest


The level is built up by joining a quest (B say) onto an
existing quest (A say).  Unless the quests have the same
status (such as being mini quests with the same parent),
then the join requires a locked door.

The rule for what kind of door is simple: assuming B is a
lock quest, then the lock for the door is the one picked up
(or switched) on the lock quest IMMEDIATELY BEFORE quest B.
Mini quests normally connect to their parent quest and hence
don't need any lock.

To refer to the example above: Quest 2 needs a red-keyed
door where it joins onto quest 1.  Quest 3 needs a blue
switched door where it joins onto quest 2 (or 1), and
Quest 4 needs a yellow-keyed door where it joins onto
quest 3 (or 2 or 1).


Hexen Details
-------------

Hexen is more complicated because of the hub system
which allows the player to travel back-n-forth between
different maps.

Oblige creates each episode using six maps:
  1 = starting map
  2 = map containing key A
  3 = map containing key B
  4 = weapon pieces map
  5 = secret map
  6 = boss (end) map

Key A is required to get to the boss level, and Key B is
required to get to the level containing the three pieces
of the super weapon.

For Hexen maps there are some additional types of quests.
The "gate" quest leads to a teleporter to a different map,
and a "back" quest leads to the teleporter that comes back.

Gate quests are usually mini quests, because when the
player comes back nothing has been unlocked.  Even for
the two get-the-key levels, the gate quests are still
mini quests since the keys are not used to control the
progression /per se/ of the source map (the keys are
used for access to the gates to the weapon/boss levels).

The exception is the gate quest to the boss map, which
is always used as the end quest of the start map.

The "back" quests are normally used as end quests to the
levels that the gate quests lead to.  The exception here
is the Boss level, because the end quest on boss maps is
the big bloody battle between the player and the bad-ass
dude.


Finally: the gates to the super weapon level and to the
boss level are special since they must require a keyed
door (using a key that might not be given by any quests
on the map).  Hence they are mini quests which force the
door to be keyed (and do not "extend" their parent).


Example:
--------

start_map
  1. lock quest (press moon switch)
     1.1 mini quest (gate -> key A map)
     1.2 mini quest (gate -> weapon map)

  2. end quest (gate to boss map)
     2.1 mini quest (gate -> key B map)

key_A_map
  1. lock quest (key A)
     1.1 mini quest (gate -> secret level)
     1.2 mini quest (weapon#2)

  2. end quest (back -> start map)

key_B_map
  1. lock quest (press chain switch)
     1.1 mini quest (weapon#3)

  2. local quest (key B)
     2.1 mini quest (item "porkulator")

  3. end quest (back -> start map)

boss_map
  1. lock quest (axe key)

  2. end quest (boss "korax")
     2.1 mini quest (back -> start map)
