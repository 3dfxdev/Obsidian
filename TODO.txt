   chunk        all          small exit room, large cage

   middle       floor        pedestal, fountain, crate, teleport pad

   corner       all          diagonal corner, cage

   corner       ceil         ???

   ???                       3D bridge



-  position-based monster ordering 



Hallways:
  !!  monsters / items in hallways
      --> set 'belong_room' of hallway, add hall mons to that battle

  !!  fix chunk alignment in hallway connections

  +  proper height setting, use lifts when necessary


Cross-Overs:
  !!  heights are messed up?

  +  build the bridges / channels using prefabs

  -  sometimes make a dramatic height difference

  -  fix hallway vertical gaps


Street Mode:
DONE: limit to once per episode (higher prob in secret level)

  +  limit number of locked rooms:
     (a) if too many rooms, merge some
     (b) make some rooms be optional (storehouses or weapon)
     (c) connect some rooms via 3D bridges
  
  -  fix the sky glitch (pieces jutting inside a room)

  -  better looking "streets" (via prefabs and SKINs)

  -  fix the "big junc" situation, good place for a fountain

  -  a raised outdoory room might be cool

  -  25% of the time  : keep the outer ring
     25% of the time  : expand all rooms into outer ring
     rest of the time : expand corner rooms 50%, side rooms 33%

  WISH: 3D bridges between two buildings


-----------------------------------------------------------------


WISH: 3D bridges can be 3D stairs [relax area touching rule]



FIX: areas may be separated by "scenic" chunks
     --> prevent that, c.f. sub-room logic in V3


Windows: MUST decide them after all heights are done



5. corner prefab -- chunk is assumed not to be passable anymore,
   can make the whole thing solid [c.f. the V3 corner seeds]
   or make a curve or diagonal -- anything a prefab can do.
   
   need to make sure that room stays traversible

6. wall prefab -- touches one (and only one) edge of room,
   could make whole thing solid, or whatever a prefab can do.

7. big middle prefab, e.g. nukage pit



>>>  Simple rooms (caves and mazes)



OTHER STUFF

!!  u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

    x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
    y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)


+  Hexen stuff:
   
   +  BOSS map : do bossy stuff

   +  BOSS map : require the 2/3 hub keys to access boss room
                 NOTE: could use them to restrict progress along chain

   DONE: hub gates between the levels
   DONE: weapons for fight simulator
   DONE: prevent key re-use


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Goals for next WIP
==================

+  crossovers

+  proper building facades

+  windows and fences

-  sky borders in outdoor rooms

+  system for texture coordinates


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

+  working pictures

+  caves working again

+  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

+  liquid areas


-  normal doors

-  cages

-  secret niches


?  better exits

?  diagonal corners

?  void seeds
