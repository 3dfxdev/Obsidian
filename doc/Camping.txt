PREVENT CAMPING
===============


ESSELFORTIUM:

It can be tricky to avoid camping scenarios, sure, but it's absolutely
possible without resorting to the cliche of blocking bars in every
doorway.

- Height dropoffs (which can be done in so many different ways)

- Nukage runs (whether putting nukage leading up to a setpiece area to
  keep the player in it, or by giving them a radsuit to limit their time
  spent in the setpiece area itself)

- Teleporting the player to a new section

- Teleporting monsters behind the player to chase them into a bigger fight

- Putting needed supplies where the player can see them but can only get
  them by crossing the room and waking up monsters
