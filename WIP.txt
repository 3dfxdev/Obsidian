WORK IN PROGRESS
================


++  CONSIDER: should arches simply be a kind of door?

    I think it boils down to: should every normal hallway REQUIRE
    a door or arch where it meets a room?


-  IDEA: 'override' value for prefabs, default to zero.
         when > 0, remove all other possible prefabs from the list
         which have a lower value


++  priority for spots  (skill flag)
       if EASY set OR nothing set --> priority = 1
       elseif MEDIUM --> priority = 2
       else              priority = 3

    ALWAYS prefer a higher priority over a lower one.


+  Hallways: make more monsters


+  mark used goal spots as unusable for mons/items


!!  get cycles working again

    DONE:  update stair_flow() with 'cycle' parameter, use it do
       determine stair pieces (and skip some other logic).

    DONE:  handle 'cycle_excess' : create a step (if abs >= 12)
       (step should be at beginning for downward cycles)

    -  ensure 'is_joiner' is never set for cycles

    -  if a locked door is placed in a joiner, don't create cycles
       for it.


+  'action' field in a switch prefab, must match door used
   values can be: "raise", "lower", "stair"


-  in a single-section hallway, prevent a door on both sides


+  Big junctions: add a wall at edges where no hallway exists


!!  get joiners working again


>>  get 'height' value into 'env' pick_skin() tables


-  FAT_CAGE_PILLAR
