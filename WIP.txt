WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Layout rework:
-  score pattern higher based on # of different floors touched by conns

-  link chunks together
-  create chunks for flat square room

-  recursive patterns!

-  get stairs working again
-  get diagonals working again
-  get curved stairs working again

-  get 3d bridges working
-  get 3d floors working


Border pieces:
-  number of T pieces: int(seed_w / 3)
-  fix textures on corner cage
-  only 30% chance of corner cage [apply style]
-  support "gaps" in piece sides (filled by lowest nearby sector OR next lowest sector)
-  tidy up current pieces

+  problem: piece may be inaccessible (due to max_floor_h or
   walkable seed not occurring near a border)
   ---> after layout room, detect which pieces are accessible

-  IDEA: middle seed (etc) can become place for item/start/exit/teleporter

-  support piece with spot for nice item, if room has item then
   place it there
-  support piece as start spot
-  support piece which is EXIT


Fix handling of gaps inside caves (at border of cave)
-  always do it in Cave_xxx code, NOT make_border() code
-  "cave_wall" -- support as a low fence too ("cave_fence" ?)


Bridges:
-  bridges : check two/three seeds for LONG bridges
-  have an actual bridge
-  add mon/item spots to prefabs
-  support a 3D floor [another special sector?]


Junking:
-  caves: sometimes junk a side or two
   - only at edge of map
   - 1 or 2 seeds deep

-  normal junking : upto 2 seeds at edge of map


Closets and Traps:
-  can use unused seeds [inside map area]
-  can use junked parts of a room
-  can use a SOLID seed in a pattern (c.f. cage code)

-  can steal part of a nearby scenic, but require all three sides
   (and two diagonals) to remain part of scenic room


Doors
-  door with bars
-  make a two seed wide door prefab
-  support wide doors [normal / locked]
-  make wide prefab with a switch in it [normal door]
-  texturing on door prefabs (for HELL, URBAN themes)
