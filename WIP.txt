WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Monster Rework
--------------

+  planning : proper "count" in create_a_fight
   [ take used[mon] value into account ]
   [[ maybe 'density' of the monster too ]]
   [[[ ideally OB_CONFIG.strength too ]]]


-  adapt the "zone palette" code to use for each room
   [ apply global "less" setting on top of it ]

-  decide the HP-limit for each room

-  decide the DMG-limit for each room

-  pick monsters to use in each room which complies with the
   above limits

-  assign places (floor chunks) for boss fights

-  create OMG files, compare with demo analyses


+  fix the monster control modules

-  fix the ZDoom Marines module

-  fix the Stealth Monsters module


-  no need for EPISODE.seen_weapons being used OUTSIDE of
   Episode_plan_weapons()

??  replace "dist_to_end" (whatever) with something DECENT
    -  a big boss fight every half-episode

IDEA : "glacial" setting for Ramp-Up



Miscellaneous
-------------

-  void up cages in secret rooms (most of the time)

-  get posts working with rail junctions again

-  scenic: need posts where two different floor heights meet



Web Site
--------

-  update Usage page on THEME setting, e.g.:

   the "Jumbled" theme setting means each map's theme is chosen purely
   randomly (and usually different from the last), where "bit mixed" means groups of maps (2-4)
   have the same theme before choosing a new (random) one.  The "xxx-ish"
   settings means you get mostly "xxx" but with an occasionally different one
   thrown in.
