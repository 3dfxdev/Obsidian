Current Work
------------

TEST: hyperlink code in Windows


THEME SYSTEM:

-  pick a hallway theme, cave theme, one or two outdoor theme
   and one or two building themes for each zone.
   
-  when user has seen too much of a room theme (some seed quota)
   then pick a new one for the room, but go back to start if run out.

   --> perhaps a more general "tiredness" idea : compute how much
       of the theme has been used uptil any given point, and when
       it exceeds a threshhold then switch room themes (and reduce
       previous tiredness values while a different theme is in use).

       [hmmm probably too complex, zones already help a lot]

-  support rarity="zone" in room themes, pick it, use it once and
   never again in the zone.  support "level" keyword too.

DONE:  select facades _first_, allow "_FACADE" in wall choices

-  if keys are left over, can use them for non-Zone locks

-  REVIEW: need a zone_quota ?

+  split current room themes into smaller ones


NO: allow materials in 'facades', 'walls' (etc) to not exist,
    and simply remove that entry from the table.  Same for entity
    stuff.  Hence can share room themes between DOOM and DOOM 2.


-  Jared's DEIMOS theme additions



Caves:
  !!!!  fix spurious diagonals (at corners of room)

  >>  newbie_map  : generate separate pass, check for <= 0 cells

  DONE:  CHUNKS: don't build floor/ceil if cave
  DONE:  handle disconnected areas
  DONE:  fill any unconnected empty areas
  DONE:  optimise touch_chunk with bbox check

  !!!!  spots for monsters and items

  >>>  get the diagonalisation working again (on FLOORS too)

  !!  determine touching lists

  >>  proper floor and ceiling textures

  -  better floors, liquid areas

  -  better ceilings, chance of sky

  -  create a large area (or two) by merging areas together
     [OR: pre-allocate a large chunk / reclaimed junction]

  DONE:  QUAKE: avoid caves for intermission camera


Monsters:
REVIEW: how strength setting affects room palettes

  +  set Cyberdemon to INSANE, but get none??

  +  in later levels, low-level monsters should be used in bigger swarms


QUAKE II:
  +  fix street mode edges (you can fall out of the level)
  [will be fixed when outdoor rooms get sky borders]


Hallways:
>>>> don't assume all chunks can be open to each other
     (i.e. there is a distinct path, put walls everywhere else)

>>>>>> fix chunk alignment in hallway connections

DONE:  proper chunk size (in other side) when one side is a JUNCTION

  !!  monsters / items in hallways

  !!!  determine ceiling heights properly

DONE: get double halls working again

  -  get big junctions working again

  -  get "merging" of one hallway into another working again

  -  ability to merge the section of a "simple" hallway into
     one of the rooms [especially to make a "Porch"].


Storage Rooms:
  -  actually use them for, um, storage

  -  prefer adding weapons into these STORAGE rooms
     (rather than another room in the quest, ESPECIALLY solution room)


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Next WIP Goals
==============

+  hallway stuff sorted out

+  cave stuff sorted out

+  theme stuff sorted out


+  proper building facades

   -  create "scenic" chunks in unused seeds as part of a building 

+  windows and fences

   -  must decide after all heights are done

   -  need to harmonize sky heights

   -  windows and fences DO NOT straddle, and outdoor rooms ARE NOT
      responsible for the outdoor facade of buildings.

+  sky borders in outdoor rooms

-  ARCH_W_WINDOW


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Release Goals
=============

-  pictures in walls

-  diagonal corners

-  secret niches

-  cages (in the void chunks)

-  normal doors

?  system for texture coordinates:

     u1..v2 for texture coords on brushes

     x_offset is alternate term for u1  [u2 can be absent]
     y_offset is alternate term for v1 or v2  (depends on 'peg' flag)

?  better ceilings, some ceiling lights

?  better exits
