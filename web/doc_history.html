<h3>HISTORY OF OBLIGE</h3>

<b>Oblige I</b> (one) was the very first incarnation,
begun around MAY 2005.
It was written in pure C++ and had a very limited architecture
(everything was in 64x64 blocks).
No monsters or items were added by it.
A notable feature was a GUI window which
showed you the shape of each generated area.
The code is still available in the <i>misc/prototype</i> folder
of the SVN repository.

<p>
<b>Oblige II</b> started development in JUNE 2006, using Lua scripts
for the level creation logic and C++ for the GUI front-end
and WAD output code.  This evolved with many features and
support for several games into the first public release of
Oblige : version 0.81.

<p>
<b>Oblige III</b> is the current incarnation.
Severe limitations in the previous code prompted a huge rewrite,
a process which is still on-going.
