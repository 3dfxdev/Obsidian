WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Monsters
--------

+  more sophisticated handling of monster roles
   [ e.g. eventually use Archviles in cages and traps ]

-  bring back "skip_prob", and have a global palette
   with "none", "less" and "some"

-  each monster has a "boss_level" value, defaulting to 1

   we compute an effective boss level of each monster for each map
   [ e.g. map_boss_levels[mon] = info.boss_lev - N * game_along ]

   when effective level is < 4, then monster can be used as "fodder",
   otherwise monster can only be used in a boss fight.

   the HP-limit and DMG-limit don't apply to the boss monsters in a room
   [ though they may be reduced to account for them ]


-  a big boss fight every half-episode



Miscellaneous
-------------

-  void up cages in secret rooms (most of the time)

-  assign a floor chunk for boss fights

-  get posts working with rail junctions again

-  scenic: need posts where two different floor heights meet



Web Site
--------

-  update Usage page on THEME setting, e.g.:

   the "Jumbled" theme setting means each map's theme is chosen purely
   randomly (and usually different from the last), where "bit mixed" means groups of maps (2-4)
   have the same theme before choosing a new (random) one.  The "xxx-ish"
   settings means you get mostly "xxx" but with an occasionally different one
   thrown in.
